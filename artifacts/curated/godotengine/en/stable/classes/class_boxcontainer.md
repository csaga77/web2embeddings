## Enumerations

enum AlignmentMode:

AlignmentMode ALIGNMENT_BEGIN = `0`

The child controls will be arranged at the beginning of the container, i.e.
top if orientation is vertical, left if orientation is horizontal (right for
RTL layout).

AlignmentMode ALIGNMENT_CENTER = `1`

The child controls will be centered in the container.

AlignmentMode ALIGNMENT_END = `2`

The child controls will be arranged at the end of the container, i.e. bottom
if orientation is vertical, right if orientation is horizontal (left for RTL
layout).

## Property Descriptions

AlignmentMode alignment = `0`

  * void set_alignment(value: AlignmentMode)

  * AlignmentMode get_alignment()

The alignment of the container's children (must be one of ALIGNMENT_BEGIN,
ALIGNMENT_CENTER, or ALIGNMENT_END).

bool vertical = `false`

  * void set_vertical(value: bool)

  * bool is_vertical()

If `true`, the BoxContainer will arrange its children vertically, rather than
horizontally.

Can't be changed when using HBoxContainer and VBoxContainer.

## Method Descriptions

Control add_spacer(begin: bool)

Adds a Control node to the box as a spacer. If `begin` is `true`, it will
insert the Control node in front of all other children.

## Theme Property Descriptions

int separation = `4`

The space between the BoxContainer's elements, in pixels.
