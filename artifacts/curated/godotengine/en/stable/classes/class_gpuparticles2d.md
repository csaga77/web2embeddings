# GPUParticles2D

Inherits: Node2D < CanvasItem < Node < Object

A 2D particle emitter.

## Description

2D particle node used to create a variety of particle systems and effects.
GPUParticles2D features an emitter that generates some number of particles at
a given rate.

Use the process_material property to add a ParticleProcessMaterial to
configure particle appearance and behavior. Alternatively, you can add a
ShaderMaterial which will be applied to all particles.

2D particles can optionally collide with LightOccluder2D, but they don't
collide with PhysicsBody2D nodes.

## Signals

finished()

Emitted when all active particles have finished processing. To immediately
restart the emission cycle, call restart().

This signal is never emitted when one_shot is disabled, as particles will be
emitted and processed continuously.

Note: For one_shot emitters, due to the particles being computed on the GPU,
there may be a short period after receiving the signal during which setting
emitting to `true` will not restart the emission cycle. This delay is avoided
by instead calling restart().

## Enumerations

enum DrawOrder:

DrawOrder DRAW_ORDER_INDEX = `0`

Particles are drawn in the order emitted.

DrawOrder DRAW_ORDER_LIFETIME = `1`

Particles are drawn in order of remaining lifetime. In other words, the
particle with the highest lifetime is drawn at the front.

DrawOrder DRAW_ORDER_REVERSE_LIFETIME = `2`

Particles are drawn in reverse order of remaining lifetime. In other words,
the particle with the lowest lifetime is drawn at the front.

enum EmitFlags:

EmitFlags EMIT_FLAG_POSITION = `1`

Particle starts at the specified position.

EmitFlags EMIT_FLAG_ROTATION_SCALE = `2`

Particle starts with specified rotation and scale.

EmitFlags EMIT_FLAG_VELOCITY = `4`

Particle starts with the specified velocity vector, which defines the emission
direction and speed.

EmitFlags EMIT_FLAG_COLOR = `8`

Particle starts with specified color.

EmitFlags EMIT_FLAG_CUSTOM = `16`

Particle starts with specified `CUSTOM` data.

## Property Descriptions

int amount = `8`

  * void set_amount(value: int)

  * int get_amount()

The number of particles to emit in one emission cycle. The effective emission
rate is `(amount * amount_ratio) / lifetime` particles per second. Higher
values will increase GPU requirements, even if not all particles are visible
at a given time or if amount_ratio is decreased.

Note: Changing this value will cause the particle system to restart. To avoid
this, change amount_ratio instead.

float amount_ratio = `1.0`

  * void set_amount_ratio(value: float)

  * float get_amount_ratio()

The ratio of particles that should actually be emitted. If set to a value
lower than `1.0`, this will set the amount of emitted particles throughout the
lifetime to `amount * amount_ratio`. Unlike changing amount, changing
amount_ratio while emitting does not affect already-emitted particles and
doesn't cause the particle system to restart. amount_ratio can be used to
create effects that make the number of emitted particles vary over time.

Note: Reducing the amount_ratio has no performance benefit, since resources
need to be allocated and processed for the total amount of particles
regardless of the amount_ratio. If you don't intend to change the number of
particles emitted while the particles are emitting, make sure amount_ratio is
set to `1` and change amount to your liking instead.

float collision_base_size = `1.0`

  * void set_collision_base_size(value: float)

  * float get_collision_base_size()

Multiplier for particle's collision radius. `1.0` corresponds to the size of
the sprite. If particles appear to sink into the ground when colliding,
increase this value. If particles appear to float when colliding, decrease
this value. Only effective if ParticleProcessMaterial.collision_mode is
ParticleProcessMaterial.COLLISION_RIGID or
ParticleProcessMaterial.COLLISION_HIDE_ON_CONTACT.

Note: Particles always have a spherical collision shape.

DrawOrder draw_order = `1`

  * void set_draw_order(value: DrawOrder)

  * DrawOrder get_draw_order()

Particle draw order. Uses DrawOrder values.

bool emitting = `true`

  * void set_emitting(value: bool)

  * bool is_emitting()

If `true`, particles are being emitted. emitting can be used to start and stop
particles from emitting. However, if one_shot is `true` setting emitting to
`true` will not restart the emission cycle unless all active particles have
finished processing. Use the finished signal to be notified once all active
particles finish processing.

Note: For one_shot emitters, due to the particles being computed on the GPU,
there may be a short period after receiving the finished signal during which
setting this to `true` will not restart the emission cycle.

Tip: If your one_shot emitter needs to immediately restart emitting particles
once finished signal is received, consider calling restart() instead of
setting emitting.

float explosiveness = `0.0`

  * void set_explosiveness_ratio(value: float)

  * float get_explosiveness_ratio()

How rapidly particles in an emission cycle are emitted. If greater than `0`,
there will be a gap in emissions before the next cycle begins.

int fixed_fps = `30`

  * void set_fixed_fps(value: int)

  * int get_fixed_fps()

The particle system's frame rate is fixed to a value. For example, changing
the value to 2 will make the particles render at 2 frames per second. Note
this does not slow down the simulation of the particle system itself.

bool fract_delta = `true`

  * void set_fractional_delta(value: bool)

  * bool get_fractional_delta()

If `true`, results in fractional delta calculation which has a smoother
particles display effect.

float interp_to_end = `0.0`

  * void set_interp_to_end(value: float)

  * float get_interp_to_end()

Causes all the particles in this node to interpolate towards the end of their
lifetime.

Note: This only works when used with a ParticleProcessMaterial. It needs to be
manually implemented for custom process shaders.

bool interpolate = `true`

  * void set_interpolate(value: bool)

  * bool get_interpolate()

Enables particle interpolation, which makes the particle movement smoother
when their fixed_fps is lower than the screen refresh rate.

float lifetime = `1.0`

  * void set_lifetime(value: float)

  * float get_lifetime()

The amount of time each particle will exist (in seconds). The effective
emission rate is `(amount * amount_ratio) / lifetime` particles per second.

bool local_coords = `false`

  * void set_use_local_coordinates(value: bool)

  * bool get_use_local_coordinates()

If `true`, particles use the parent node's coordinate space (known as local
coordinates). This will cause particles to move and rotate along the
GPUParticles2D node (and its parents) when it is moved or rotated. If `false`,
particles use global coordinates; they will not move or rotate along the
GPUParticles2D node (and its parents) when it is moved or rotated.

bool one_shot = `false`

  * void set_one_shot(value: bool)

  * bool get_one_shot()

If `true`, only one emission cycle occurs. If set `true` during a cycle,
emission will stop at the cycle's end.

float preprocess = `0.0`

  * void set_pre_process_time(value: float)

  * float get_pre_process_time()

Particle system starts as if it had already run for this many seconds.

Note: This can be very expensive if set to a high number as it requires
running the particle shader a number of times equal to the fixed_fps (or 30,
if fixed_fps is 0) for every second. In extreme cases it can even lead to a
GPU crash due to the volume of work done in a single frame.

Material process_material

  * void set_process_material(value: Material)

  * Material get_process_material()

Material for processing particles. Can be a ParticleProcessMaterial or a
ShaderMaterial.

float randomness = `0.0`

  * void set_randomness_ratio(value: float)

  * float get_randomness_ratio()

Emission lifetime randomness ratio.

int seed = `0`

  * void set_seed(value: int)

  * int get_seed()

Sets the random seed used by the particle system. Only effective if
use_fixed_seed is `true`.

float speed_scale = `1.0`

  * void set_speed_scale(value: float)

  * float get_speed_scale()

Particle system's running speed scaling ratio. A value of `0` can be used to
pause the particles.

NodePath sub_emitter = `NodePath("")`

  * void set_sub_emitter(value: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_sub_emitter()

Path to another GPUParticles2D node that will be used as a subemitter (see
ParticleProcessMaterial.sub_emitter_mode). Subemitters can be used to achieve
effects such as fireworks, sparks on collision, bubbles popping into water
drops, and more.

Note: When sub_emitter is set, the target GPUParticles2D node will no longer
emit particles on its own.

Texture2D texture

  * void set_texture(value: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture()

Particle texture. If `null`, particles will be squares with a size of 11
pixels.

Note: To use a flipbook texture, assign a new CanvasItemMaterial to the
GPUParticles2D's CanvasItem.material property, then enable
CanvasItemMaterial.particles_animation and set
CanvasItemMaterial.particles_anim_h_frames,
CanvasItemMaterial.particles_anim_v_frames, and
CanvasItemMaterial.particles_anim_loop to match the flipbook texture.

bool trail_enabled = `false`

  * void set_trail_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_trail_enabled()

If `true`, enables particle trails using a mesh skinning system.

Note: Unlike GPUParticles3D, the number of trail sections and subdivisions is
set with the trail_sections and trail_section_subdivisions properties.

float trail_lifetime = `0.3`

  * void set_trail_lifetime(value: float)

  * float get_trail_lifetime()

The amount of time the particle's trail should represent (in seconds). Only
effective if trail_enabled is `true`.

int trail_section_subdivisions = `4`

  * void set_trail_section_subdivisions(value: int)

  * int get_trail_section_subdivisions()

The number of subdivisions to use for the particle trail rendering. Higher
values can result in smoother trail curves, at the cost of performance due to
increased mesh complexity. See also trail_sections. Only effective if
trail_enabled is `true`.

int trail_sections = `8`

  * void set_trail_sections(value: int)

  * int get_trail_sections()

The number of sections to use for the particle trail rendering. Higher values
can result in smoother trail curves, at the cost of performance due to
increased mesh complexity. See also trail_section_subdivisions. Only effective
if trail_enabled is `true`.

bool use_fixed_seed = `false`

  * void set_use_fixed_seed(value: bool)

  * bool get_use_fixed_seed()

If `true`, particles will use the same seed for every simulation using the
seed defined in seed. This is useful for situations where the visual outcome
should be consistent across replays, for example when using Movie Maker mode.

Rect2 visibility_rect = `Rect2(-100, -100, 200, 200)`

  * void set_visibility_rect(value: Rect2)

  * Rect2 get_visibility_rect()

The Rect2 that determines the node's region which needs to be visible on
screen for the particle system to be active.

Grow the rect if particles suddenly appear/disappear when the node
enters/exits the screen. The Rect2 can be grown via code or with the Particles
Generate Visibility Rect editor tool.

## Method Descriptions

Rect2 capture_rect() const

Returns a rectangle containing the positions of all existing particles.

Note: When using threaded rendering this method synchronizes the rendering
thread. Calling it often may have a negative impact on performance.

void convert_from_particles(particles: Node)

Sets this node's properties to match a given CPUParticles2D node.

void emit_particle(xform: Transform2D, velocity: Vector2, color: Color,
custom: Color, flags: int)

Emits a single particle. Whether `xform`, `velocity`, `color` and `custom` are
applied depends on the value of `flags`. See EmitFlags.

The default ParticleProcessMaterial will overwrite `color` and use the
contents of `custom` as `(rotation, age, animation, lifetime)`.

Note: emit_particle() is only supported on the Forward+ and Mobile rendering
methods, not Compatibility.

void request_particles_process(process_time: float)

Requests the particles to process for extra process time during a single
frame.

Useful for particle playback, if used in combination with use_fixed_seed or by
calling restart() with parameter `keep_seed` set to `true`.

void restart(keep_seed: bool = false)

Restarts the particle emission cycle, clearing existing particles. To avoid
particles vanishing from the viewport, wait for the finished signal before
calling.

Note: The finished signal is only emitted by one_shot emitters.

If `keep_seed` is `true`, the current random seed will be preserved. Useful
for seeking and playback.
