# PinJoint3D

Inherits: Joint3D < Node3D < Node < Object

A physics joint that attaches two 3D physics bodies at a single point,
allowing them to freely rotate.

## Description

A physics joint that attaches two 3D physics bodies at a single point,
allowing them to freely rotate. For example, a RigidBody3D can be attached to
a StaticBody3D to create a pendulum or a seesaw.

## Properties

float | params/bias | `0.3`  
---|---|---  
float | params/damping | `1.0`  
float | params/impulse_clamp | `0.0`  
  
## Methods

float | get_param(param: Param) const  
---|---  
void | set_param(param: Param, value: float)  
  
## Enumerations

enum Param:

Param PARAM_BIAS = `0`

The force with which the pinned objects stay in positional relation to each
other. The higher, the stronger.

Param PARAM_DAMPING = `1`

The force with which the pinned objects stay in velocity relation to each
other. The higher, the stronger.

Param PARAM_IMPULSE_CLAMP = `2`

If above 0, this value is the maximum value for an impulse that this Joint3D
produces.

## Property Descriptions

float params/bias = `0.3`

  * void set_param(param: Param, value: float)

  * float get_param(param: Param) const

The force with which the pinned objects stay in positional relation to each
other. The higher, the stronger.

float params/damping = `1.0`

  * void set_param(param: Param, value: float)

  * float get_param(param: Param) const

The force with which the pinned objects stay in velocity relation to each
other. The higher, the stronger.

float params/impulse_clamp = `0.0`

  * void set_param(param: Param, value: float)

  * float get_param(param: Param) const

If above 0, this value is the maximum value for an impulse that this Joint3D
produces.

## Method Descriptions

float get_param(param: Param) const

Returns the value of the specified parameter.

void set_param(param: Param, value: float)

Sets the value of the specified parameter.
