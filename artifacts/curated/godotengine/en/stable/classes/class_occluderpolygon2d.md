# OccluderPolygon2D

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

Defines a 2D polygon for LightOccluder2D.

## Description

Editor facility that helps you draw a 2D polygon used as resource for
LightOccluder2D.

## Properties

bool | closed | `true`  
---|---|---  
CullMode | cull_mode | `0`  
PackedVector2Array | polygon | `PackedVector2Array()`  
  
## Enumerations

enum CullMode:

CullMode CULL_DISABLED = `0`

Culling is disabled. See cull_mode.

CullMode CULL_CLOCKWISE = `1`

Culling is performed in the clockwise direction. See cull_mode.

CullMode CULL_COUNTER_CLOCKWISE = `2`

Culling is performed in the counterclockwise direction. See cull_mode.

## Property Descriptions

bool closed = `true`

  * void set_closed(value: bool)

  * bool is_closed()

If `true`, closes the polygon. A closed OccluderPolygon2D occludes the light
coming from any direction. An opened OccluderPolygon2D occludes the light only
at its outline's direction.

CullMode cull_mode = `0`

  * void set_cull_mode(value: CullMode)

  * CullMode get_cull_mode()

The culling mode to use.

PackedVector2Array polygon = `PackedVector2Array()`

  * void set_polygon(value: PackedVector2Array)

  * PackedVector2Array get_polygon()

A Vector2 array with the index for polygon's vertices positions.

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedVector2Array for more details.
