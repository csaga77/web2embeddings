# ImageFormatLoaderExtension

Inherits: ImageFormatLoader < RefCounted < Object

Base class for creating ImageFormatLoader extensions (adding support for extra
image formats).

## Description

The engine supports multiple image formats out of the box (PNG, SVG, JPEG,
WebP to name a few), but you can choose to implement support for additional
image formats by extending this class.

Be sure to respect the documented return types and values. You should create
an instance of it, and call add_format_loader() to register that loader during
the initialization phase.

## Methods

PackedStringArray | _get_recognized_extensions() virtual const  
---|---  
Error | _load_image(image: Image, fileaccess: FileAccess, flags: BitField[LoaderFlags], scale: float) virtual  
void | add_format_loader()  
void | remove_format_loader()  
  
## Method Descriptions

PackedStringArray _get_recognized_extensions() virtual const

Returns the list of file extensions for this image format. Files with the
given extensions will be treated as image file and loaded using this class.

Error _load_image(image: Image, fileaccess: FileAccess, flags:
BitField[LoaderFlags], scale: float) virtual

Loads the content of `fileaccess` into the provided `image`.

void add_format_loader()

Add this format loader to the engine, allowing it to recognize the file
extensions returned by _get_recognized_extensions().

void remove_format_loader()

Remove this format loader from the engine.
