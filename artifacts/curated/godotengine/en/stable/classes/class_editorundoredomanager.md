# EditorUndoRedoManager

Inherits: Object

Manages undo history of scenes opened in the editor.

## Description

EditorUndoRedoManager is a manager for UndoRedo objects associated with edited
scenes. Each scene has its own undo history and EditorUndoRedoManager ensures
that each action performed in the editor gets associated with a proper scene.
For actions not related to scenes (ProjectSettings edits, external resources,
etc.), a separate global history is used.

The usage is mostly the same as UndoRedo. You create and commit actions and
the manager automatically decides under-the-hood what scenes it belongs to.
The scene is deduced based on the first operation in an action, using the
object from the operation. The rules are as follows:

  * If the object is a Node, use the currently edited scene;

  * If the object is a built-in resource, use the scene from its path;

  * If the object is external resource or anything else, use global history.

This guessing can sometimes yield false results, so you can provide a custom
context object when creating an action.

EditorUndoRedoManager is intended to be used by Godot editor plugins. You can
obtain it using EditorPlugin.get_undo_redo(). For non-editor uses or plugins
that don't need to integrate with the editor's undo history, use UndoRedo
instead.

The manager's API is mostly the same as in UndoRedo, so you can refer to its
documentation for more examples. The main difference is that
EditorUndoRedoManager uses object + method name for actions, instead of
Callable.

## Signals

history_changed()

Emitted when the list of actions in any history has changed, either when an
action is committed or a history is cleared.

version_changed()

Emitted when the version of any history has changed as a result of undo or
redo call.

## Enumerations

enum SpecialHistory:

SpecialHistory GLOBAL_HISTORY = `0`

Global history not associated with any scene, but with external resources etc.

SpecialHistory REMOTE_HISTORY = `-9`

History associated with remote inspector. Used when live editing a running
project.

SpecialHistory INVALID_HISTORY = `-99`

Invalid "null" history. It's a special value, not associated with any object.

## Method Descriptions

void add_do_method(object: Object, method: StringName, ...) vararg

Register a method that will be called when the action is committed (i.e. the
"do" action).

If this is the first operation, the `object` will be used to deduce target
undo history.

void add_do_property(object: Object, property: StringName, value: Variant)

Register a property value change for "do".

If this is the first operation, the `object` will be used to deduce target
undo history.

void add_do_reference(object: Object)

Register a reference for "do" that will be erased if the "do" history is lost.
This is useful mostly for new nodes created for the "do" call. Do not use for
resources.

void add_undo_method(object: Object, method: StringName, ...) vararg

Register a method that will be called when the action is undone (i.e. the
"undo" action).

If this is the first operation, the `object` will be used to deduce target
undo history.

void add_undo_property(object: Object, property: StringName, value: Variant)

Register a property value change for "undo".

If this is the first operation, the `object` will be used to deduce target
undo history.

void add_undo_reference(object: Object)

Register a reference for "undo" that will be erased if the "undo" history is
lost. This is useful mostly for nodes removed with the "do" call (not the
"undo" call!).

void clear_history(id: int = -99, increase_version: bool = true)

Clears the given undo history. You can clear history for a specific scene,
global history, or for all scenes at once if `id` is INVALID_HISTORY.

If `increase_version` is `true`, the undo history version will be increased,
marking it as unsaved. Useful for operations that modify the scene, but don't
support undo.

    
    
    var scene_root = EditorInterface.get_edited_scene_root()
    var undo_redo = EditorInterface.get_editor_undo_redo()
    undo_redo.clear_history(undo_redo.get_object_history_id(scene_root))
    

Note: If you want to mark an edited scene as unsaved without clearing its
history, use EditorInterface.mark_scene_as_unsaved() instead.

void commit_action(execute: bool = true)

Commits the action. If `execute` is `true` (default), all "do"
methods/properties are called/set when this function is called.

void create_action(name: String, merge_mode: MergeMode = 0, custom_context:
Object = null, backward_undo_ops: bool = false)

Create a new action. After this is called, do all your calls to
add_do_method(), add_undo_method(), add_do_property(), and
add_undo_property(), then commit the action with commit_action().

The way actions are merged is dictated by the `merge_mode` argument. See
MergeMode for details.

If `custom_context` object is provided, it will be used for deducing target
history (instead of using the first operation).

The way undo operation are ordered in actions is dictated by
`backward_undo_ops`. When `backward_undo_ops` is `false` undo option are
ordered in the same order they were added. Which means the first operation to
be added will be the first to be undone.

void force_fixed_history()

Forces the next operation (e.g. add_do_method()) to use the action's history
rather than guessing it from the object. This is sometimes needed when a
history can't be correctly determined, like for a nested resource that doesn't
have a path yet.

This method should only be used when absolutely necessary, otherwise it might
cause invalid history state. For most of complex cases, the `custom_context`
parameter of create_action() is sufficient.

UndoRedo get_history_undo_redo(id: int) const

Returns the UndoRedo object associated with the given history `id`.

`id` above `0` are mapped to the opened scene tabs (but it doesn't match their
order). `id` of `0` or lower have special meaning (see SpecialHistory).

Best used with get_object_history_id(). This method is only provided in case
you need some more advanced methods of UndoRedo (but keep in mind that
directly operating on the UndoRedo object might affect editor's stability).

int get_object_history_id(object: Object) const

Returns the history ID deduced from the given `object`. It can be used with
get_history_undo_redo().

bool is_committing_action() const

Returns `true` if the EditorUndoRedoManager is currently committing the
action, i.e. running its "do" method or property change (see commit_action()).
