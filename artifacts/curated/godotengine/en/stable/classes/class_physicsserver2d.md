# PhysicsServer2D

Inherits: Object

Inherited By: PhysicsServer2DExtension

A server interface for low-level 2D physics access.

## Description

PhysicsServer2D is the server responsible for all 2D physics. It can directly
create and manipulate all physics objects:

  * A space is a self-contained world for a physics simulation. It contains bodies, areas, and joints. Its state can be queried for collision and intersection information, and several parameters of the simulation can be modified.

  * A shape is a geometric shape such as a circle, a rectangle, a capsule, or a polygon. It can be used for collision detection by adding it to a body/area, possibly with an extra transformation relative to the body/area's origin. Bodies/areas can have multiple (transformed) shapes added to them, and a single shape can be added to bodies/areas multiple times with different local transformations.

  * A body is a physical object which can be in static, kinematic, or rigid mode. Its state (such as position and velocity) can be queried and updated. A force integration callback can be set to customize the body's physics.

  * An area is a region in space which can be used to detect bodies and areas entering and exiting it. A body monitoring callback can be set to report entering/exiting body shapes, and similarly an area monitoring callback can be set. Gravity and damping can be overridden within the area by setting area parameters.

  * A joint is a constraint, either between two bodies or on one body relative to a point. Parameters such as the joint bias and the rest length of a spring joint can be adjusted.

Physics objects in PhysicsServer2D may be created and manipulated
independently; they do not have to be tied to nodes in the scene tree.

Note: All the 2D physics nodes use the physics server internally. Adding a
physics node to the scene tree will cause a corresponding physics object to be
created in the physics server. A rigid body node registers a callback that
updates the node's transform with the transform of the respective body object
in the physics server (every physics update). An area node registers a
callback to inform the area node about overlaps with the respective area
object in the physics server. The raycast node queries the direct state of the
relevant space in the physics server.

## Enumerations

enum SpaceParameter:

SpaceParameter SPACE_PARAM_CONTACT_RECYCLE_RADIUS = `0`

Constant to set/get the maximum distance a pair of bodies has to move before
their collision status has to be recalculated. The default value of this
parameter is ProjectSettings.physics/2d/solver/contact_recycle_radius.

SpaceParameter SPACE_PARAM_CONTACT_MAX_SEPARATION = `1`

Constant to set/get the maximum distance a shape can be from another before
they are considered separated and the contact is discarded. The default value
of this parameter is ProjectSettings.physics/2d/solver/contact_max_separation.

SpaceParameter SPACE_PARAM_CONTACT_MAX_ALLOWED_PENETRATION = `2`

Constant to set/get the maximum distance a shape can penetrate another shape
before it is considered a collision. The default value of this parameter is
ProjectSettings.physics/2d/solver/contact_max_allowed_penetration.

SpaceParameter SPACE_PARAM_CONTACT_DEFAULT_BIAS = `3`

Constant to set/get the default solver bias for all physics contacts. A solver
bias is a factor controlling how much two objects "rebound", after
overlapping, to avoid leaving them in that state because of numerical
imprecision. The default value of this parameter is
ProjectSettings.physics/2d/solver/default_contact_bias.

SpaceParameter SPACE_PARAM_BODY_LINEAR_VELOCITY_SLEEP_THRESHOLD = `4`

Constant to set/get the threshold linear velocity of activity. A body marked
as potentially inactive for both linear and angular velocity will be put to
sleep after the time given. The default value of this parameter is
ProjectSettings.physics/2d/sleep_threshold_linear.

Constant to set/get the threshold angular velocity of activity. A body marked
as potentially inactive for both linear and angular velocity will be put to
sleep after the time given. The default value of this parameter is
ProjectSettings.physics/2d/sleep_threshold_angular.

SpaceParameter SPACE_PARAM_BODY_TIME_TO_SLEEP = `6`

Constant to set/get the maximum time of activity. A body marked as potentially
inactive for both linear and angular velocity will be put to sleep after this
time. The default value of this parameter is
ProjectSettings.physics/2d/time_before_sleep.

SpaceParameter SPACE_PARAM_CONSTRAINT_DEFAULT_BIAS = `7`

Constant to set/get the default solver bias for all physics constraints. A
solver bias is a factor controlling how much two objects "rebound", after
violating a constraint, to avoid leaving them in that state because of
numerical imprecision. The default value of this parameter is
ProjectSettings.physics/2d/solver/default_constraint_bias.

SpaceParameter SPACE_PARAM_SOLVER_ITERATIONS = `8`

Constant to set/get the number of solver iterations for all contacts and
constraints. The greater the number of iterations, the more accurate the
collisions will be. However, a greater number of iterations requires more CPU
power, which can decrease performance. The default value of this parameter is
ProjectSettings.physics/2d/solver/solver_iterations.

enum ShapeType:

ShapeType SHAPE_WORLD_BOUNDARY = `0`

This is the constant for creating world boundary shapes. A world boundary
shape is an infinite line with an origin point, and a normal. Thus, it can be
used for front/behind checks.

ShapeType SHAPE_SEPARATION_RAY = `1`

This is the constant for creating separation ray shapes. A separation ray is
defined by a length and separates itself from what is touching its far
endpoint. Useful for character controllers.

ShapeType SHAPE_SEGMENT = `2`

This is the constant for creating segment shapes. A segment shape is a finite
line from a point A to a point B. It can be checked for intersections.

ShapeType SHAPE_CIRCLE = `3`

This is the constant for creating circle shapes. A circle shape only has a
radius. It can be used for intersections and inside/outside checks.

ShapeType SHAPE_RECTANGLE = `4`

This is the constant for creating rectangle shapes. A rectangle shape is
defined by a width and a height. It can be used for intersections and
inside/outside checks.

ShapeType SHAPE_CAPSULE = `5`

This is the constant for creating capsule shapes. A capsule shape is defined
by a radius and a length. It can be used for intersections and inside/outside
checks.

ShapeType SHAPE_CONVEX_POLYGON = `6`

This is the constant for creating convex polygon shapes. A polygon is defined
by a list of points. It can be used for intersections and inside/outside
checks.

ShapeType SHAPE_CONCAVE_POLYGON = `7`

This is the constant for creating concave polygon shapes. A polygon is defined
by a list of points. It can be used for intersections checks, but not for
inside/outside checks.

ShapeType SHAPE_CUSTOM = `8`

This constant is used internally by the engine. Any attempt to create this
kind of shape results in an error.

enum AreaParameter:

AreaParameter AREA_PARAM_GRAVITY_OVERRIDE_MODE = `0`

Constant to set/get gravity override mode in an area. See
AreaSpaceOverrideMode for possible values. The default value of this parameter
is AREA_SPACE_OVERRIDE_DISABLED.

AreaParameter AREA_PARAM_GRAVITY_IS_POINT = `3`

Constant to set/get whether the gravity vector of an area is a direction, or a
center point. The default value of this parameter is `false`.

AreaParameter AREA_PARAM_GRAVITY_POINT_UNIT_DISTANCE = `4`

Constant to set/get the distance at which the gravity strength is equal to the
gravity controlled by AREA_PARAM_GRAVITY. For example, on a planet 100 pixels
in radius with a surface gravity of 4.0 px/s, set the gravity to 4.0 and the
unit distance to 100.0. The gravity will have falloff according to the inverse
square law, so in the example, at 200 pixels from the center the gravity will
be 1.0 px/s (twice the distance, 1/4th the gravity), at 50 pixels it will be
16.0 px/s (half the distance, 4x the gravity), and so on.

The above is true only when the unit distance is a positive number. When the
unit distance is set to 0.0, the gravity will be constant regardless of
distance. The default value of this parameter is `0.0`.

AreaParameter AREA_PARAM_LINEAR_DAMP_OVERRIDE_MODE = `5`

Constant to set/get linear damping override mode in an area. See
AreaSpaceOverrideMode for possible values. The default value of this parameter
is AREA_SPACE_OVERRIDE_DISABLED.

only to detect collisions, and objects entering or exiting them.

AreaSpaceOverrideMode AREA_SPACE_OVERRIDE_COMBINE = `1`

This area adds its gravity/damp values to whatever has been calculated so far.
This way, many overlapping areas can combine their physics to make interesting
effects.

AreaSpaceOverrideMode AREA_SPACE_OVERRIDE_COMBINE_REPLACE = `2`

This area adds its gravity/damp values to whatever has been calculated so far.
Then stops taking into account the rest of the areas, even the default one.

This area replaces any gravity/damp, even the default one, and stops taking
into account the rest of the areas.

AreaSpaceOverrideMode AREA_SPACE_OVERRIDE_REPLACE_COMBINE = `4`

This area replaces any gravity/damp calculated so far, but keeps calculating
the rest of the areas, down to the default one.

BodyParameter BODY_PARAM_MASS = `2`

Constant to set/get a body's mass. The default value of this parameter is
`1.0`. If the body's mode is set to BODY_MODE_RIGID, then setting this
parameter will have the following additional effects:

  * If the parameter BODY_PARAM_CENTER_OF_MASS has never been set explicitly, then the value of that parameter will be recalculated based on the body's shapes.

  * If the parameter BODY_PARAM_INERTIA is set to a value `<= 0.0`, then the value of that parameter will be recalculated based on the body's shapes, mass, and center of mass.

BodyParameter BODY_PARAM_INERTIA = `3`

Constant to set/get a body's inertia. The default value of this parameter is
`0.0`. If the body's inertia is set to a value `<= 0.0`, then the inertia will
be recalculated based on the body's shapes, mass, and center of mass.

BodyParameter BODY_PARAM_CENTER_OF_MASS = `4`

Constant to set/get a body's center of mass position in the body's local
coordinate system. The default value of this parameter is `Vector2(0,0)`. If
this parameter is never set explicitly, then it is recalculated based on the
body's shapes when setting the parameter BODY_PARAM_MASS or when calling
body_set_space().

Represents the size of the JointType enum.

enum JointParam:

JointParam JOINT_PARAM_BIAS = `0`

Constant to set/get how fast the joint pulls the bodies back to satisfy the
joint constraint. The lower the value, the more the two bodies can pull on the
joint. The default value of this parameter is `0.0`.

Note: In Godot Physics, this parameter is only used for pin joints and groove
joints.

JointParam JOINT_PARAM_MAX_BIAS = `1`

stiffness times the distance from its resting length. The default value of
this parameter is `20.0`.

## Method Descriptions

void area_add_shape(area: RID, shape: RID, transform: Transform2D =
Transform2D(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0), disabled: bool = false)

Adds a shape to the area, with the given local transform. The shape (together
with its `transform` and `disabled` properties) is added to an array of
shapes, and the shapes of an area are usually referenced by their index in
this array.

void area_attach_canvas_instance_id(area: RID, id: int)

Attaches the `ObjectID` of a canvas to the area. Use Object.get_instance_id()
to get the `ObjectID` of a CanvasLayer.

void area_attach_object_instance_id(area: RID, id: int)

Attaches the `ObjectID` of an Object to the area. Use Object.get_instance_id()
to get the `ObjectID` of a CollisionObject2D.

void area_clear_shapes(area: RID)

Removes all shapes from the area. This does not delete the shapes themselves,
so they can continue to be used elsewhere or added back later.

RID area_create()

Creates a 2D area object in the physics server, and returns the RID that
identifies it. The default settings for the created area include a collision
layer and mask set to `1`, and `monitorable` set to `false`.

Use area_add_shape() to add shapes to it, use area_set_transform() to set its
transform, and use area_set_space() to add the area to a space. If you want
the area to be detectable use area_set_monitorable().

int area_get_canvas_instance_id(area: RID) const

Returns the `ObjectID` of the canvas attached to the area. Use

have indices higher than `shape_idx` will have their index decreased by one.

void area_set_area_monitor_callback(area: RID, callback: Callable)

Sets the area's area monitor callback. This callback will be called when any
other (shape of an) area enters or exits (a shape of) the given area, and must
take the following five parameters:

  1. an integer `status`: either AREA_BODY_ADDED or AREA_BODY_REMOVED depending on whether the other area's shape entered or exited the area,

By counting (or keeping track of) the shapes that enter and exit, it can be
determined if an area (with all its shapes) is entering for the first time or

  4. an integer `body_shape_idx`: the index of the shape of the body that entered or exited the area,

  5. an integer `self_shape_idx`: the index of the shape of the area where the body entered or exited.

By counting (or keeping track of) the shapes that enter and exit, it can be
determined if a body (with all its shapes) is entering for the first time or
exiting for the last time.

Sets the value of the given area parameter. See AreaParameter for the list of
available parameters.

Transform2D)

Sets the local transform matrix of the area's shape with the given index.

void area_set_space(area: RID, space: RID)

elsewhere, use `PhysicsServer2D.area_set_space(area, RID())`.

void area_set_transform(area: RID, transform: Transform2D)

Sets the transform matrix of the area.

void body_add_collision_exception(body: RID, excepted_body: RID)

Adds `excepted_body` to the body's list of collision exceptions, so that
collisions with it are ignored.

void body_add_constant_central_force(body: RID, force: Vector2)

Adds a constant directional force to the body. The force does not affect
rotation. The force remains applied over time until cleared with
`PhysicsServer2D.body_set_constant_force(body, Vector2(0, 0))`.

This is equivalent to using body_add_constant_force() at the body's center of
mass.

void body_add_constant_force(body: RID, force: Vector2, position: Vector2 =
Vector2(0, 0))

Adds a constant positioned force to the body. The force can affect rotation if
`position` is different from the body's center of mass. The force remains

with its `transform` and `disabled` properties) is added to an array of
shapes, and the shapes of a body are usually referenced by their index in this
array.

void body_apply_central_force(body: RID, force: Vector2)

Applies a directional force to the body, at the body's center of mass. The
force does not affect rotation. A force is time dependent and meant to be
applied every physics update.

This is equivalent to using body_apply_force() at the body's center of mass.

void body_apply_central_impulse(body: RID, impulse: Vector2)

Applies a directional impulse to the body, at the body's center of mass. The
impulse does not affect rotation.

An impulse is time-independent! Applying an impulse every frame would result
in a framerate-dependent force. For this reason, it should only be used when
simulating one-time impacts (use the "_force" functions otherwise).

This is equivalent to using body_apply_impulse() at the body's center of mass.

void body_apply_force(body: RID, force: Vector2, position: Vector2 =
Vector2(0, 0))

Applies a positioned force to the body. The force can affect rotation if

dependent and meant to be applied every physics update.

`position` is the offset from the body origin in global coordinates.

void body_apply_impulse(body: RID, impulse: Vector2, position: Vector2 =
Vector2(0, 0))

Applies a positioned impulse to the body. The impulse can affect rotation if
`position` is different from the body's center of mass.

An impulse is time-independent! Applying an impulse every frame would result
in a framerate-dependent force. For this reason, it should only be used when
simulating one-time impacts (use the "_force" functions otherwise).

`position` is the offset from the body origin in global coordinates.

void body_apply_torque(body: RID, torque: float)

position.

An impulse is time-independent! Applying an impulse every frame would result
in a framerate-dependent force. For this reason, it should only be used when
simulating one-time impacts (use the "_force" functions otherwise).

Attaches the `ObjectID` of an Object to the body. Use Object.get_instance_id()
to get the `ObjectID` of a CollisionObject2D.

void body_clear_shapes(body: RID)

Removes all shapes from the body. This does not delete the shapes themselves,
so they can continue to be used elsewhere or added back later.

RID body_create()

Creates a 2D body object in the physics server, and returns the RID that
identifies it. The default settings for the created area include a collision
layer and mask set to `1`, and body mode set to BODY_MODE_RIGID.

collisions with it are no longer ignored.

void body_remove_shape(body: RID, shape_idx: int)

Removes the shape with the given index from the body's array of shapes. The
shape itself is not deleted, so it can continue to be used elsewhere or added
back later. As a result of this operation, the body's shapes which used to
have indices higher than `shape_idx` will have their index decreased by one.

void body_reset_mass_properties(body: RID)

Restores the default inertia and center of mass of the body based on its
shapes. This undoes any custom values previously set using body_set_param().

void body_set_axis_velocity(body: RID, axis_velocity: Vector2)

update.

See body_add_constant_force() and body_add_constant_central_force().

void body_set_constant_torque(body: RID, torque: float)

Sets the body's total constant rotational force applied during each physics
update.

See body_add_constant_torque().

void body_set_continuous_collision_detection_mode(body: RID, mode: CCDMode)

Sets the continuous collision detection mode using one of the CCDMode
constants.

Continuous collision detection tries to predict where a moving body would
collide in between physics updates, instead of moving it and correcting its
movement if it collided.

void body_set_force_integration_callback(body: RID, callable: Callable,
userdata: Variant = null)

Sets the body's custom force integration callback function to `callable`. Use
an empty Callable (`Callable()`) to clear the custom callback.

The function `callable` will be called every physics tick, before the standard
force integration (see body_set_omit_force_integration()). It can be used for
example to update the body's linear and angular velocity based on contact with
other bodies.

If `userdata` is not `null`, the function `callable` must take the following
two parameters:

  1. `state`: a PhysicsDirectBodyState2D used to retrieve and modify the body's state,

  2. `userdata`: a Variant; its value will be the `userdata` passed into this method.

If `userdata` is `null`, then `callable` must take only the `state` parameter.

void body_set_max_contacts_reported(body: RID, amount: int)

Sets the maximum number of contacts that the body can report. If `amount` is
greater than zero, then the body will keep track of at most this many contacts
with other bodies.

Sets the body's mode. See BodyMode for the list of available modes.

void body_set_omit_force_integration(body: RID, enable: bool)

Sets whether the body omits the standard force integration. If `enable` is
`true`, the body will not automatically use applied forces, torques, and
damping to update the body's linear and angular velocity. In this case,
body_set_force_integration_callback() can be used to manually update the
linear and angular velocity instead.

This method is called when the property RigidBody2D.custom_integrator is set.

void body_set_param(body: RID, param: BodyParameter, value: Variant)

Sets the value of the given body parameter. See BodyParameter for the list of
available parameters.

void body_set_shape(body: RID, shape_idx: int, shape: RID)

Replaces the body's shape at the given index by another shape, while not
affecting the `transform`, `disabled`, and one-way collision properties at the
same index.

void body_set_shape_as_one_way_collision(body: RID, shape_idx: int, enable:
bool, margin: float)

Sets the one-way collision properties of the body's shape with the given
index. If `enable` is `true`, the one-way collision direction given by the
shape's local upward axis `body_get_shape_transform(body, shape_idx).y` will
be used to ignore collisions with the shape in the opposite direction, and to
ensure depenetration of kinematic bodies happens in this direction.

void body_set_shape_disabled(body: RID, shape_idx: int, disabled: bool)

Sets the disabled property of the body's shape with the given index. If
`disabled` is `true`, then the shape will be ignored in all collision
detection.

void body_set_shape_transform(body: RID, shape_idx: int, transform:
Transform2D)

Sets the local transform matrix of the body's shape with the given index.

void body_set_space(body: RID, space: RID)

Adds the body to the given space, after removing the body from the previously
assigned space (if any). If the body's mode is set to BODY_MODE_RIGID, then
adding the body to a space will have the following additional effects:

  * If the parameter BODY_PARAM_CENTER_OF_MASS has never been set explicitly, then the value of that parameter will be recalculated based on the body's shapes.

  * If the parameter BODY_PARAM_INERTIA is set to a value `<= 0.0`, then the value of that parameter will be recalculated based on the body's shapes, mass, and center of mass.

Note: To remove a body from a space without immediately adding it back
elsewhere, use `PhysicsServer2D.body_set_space(body, RID())`.

void body_set_state(body: RID, state: BodyState, value: Variant)

Sets the value of a body's state. See BodyState for the list of available
states.

Note: The state change doesn't take effect immediately. The state will change
on the next physics frame.

void body_set_state_sync_callback(body: RID, callable: Callable)

Sets the body's state synchronization callback function to `callable`. Use an
empty Callable (`Callable()`) to clear the callback.

The function `callable` will be called every physics frame, assuming that the
body was active during the previous physics tick, and can be used to fetch the
latest state from the physics server.

The function `callable` must take the following parameters:

  1. `state`: a PhysicsDirectBodyState2D, used to retrieve the body's state.

bool body_test_motion(body: RID, parameters: PhysicsTestMotionParameters2D,
result: PhysicsTestMotionResult2D = null)

Returns `true` if a collision would result from moving the body along a motion
vector from a given point in space. See PhysicsTestMotionParameters2D for the
available motion parameters. Optionally a PhysicsTestMotionResult2D object can
be passed, which will be used to store the information about the resulting
collision.

in global coordinates) on the body `body_a` and at the point `anchor_b` (given
in global coordinates) on the body `body_b`. To set the parameters which are
specific to the damped spring, see damped_spring_joint_set_param().

shape_set_data() for the precise format of this data in each case.

ShapeType shape_get_type(shape: RID) const
