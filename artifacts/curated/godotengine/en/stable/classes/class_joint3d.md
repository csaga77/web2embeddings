Abstract base class for all 3D physics joints.

## Description

Abstract base class for all joints in 3D physics. 3D joints bind together two
physics bodies (node_a and node_b) and apply a constraint. If only one body is
defined, it is attached to a fixed StaticBody3D without collision shapes.

## Properties

bool | exclude_nodes_from_collision | `true`  
---|---|---  
NodePath | node_a | `NodePath("")`  
NodePath | node_b | `NodePath("")`  
int | solver_priority | `1`  
  
## Methods

RID | get_rid() const  
---|---  
  
## Property Descriptions

bool exclude_nodes_from_collision = `true`

  * void set_exclude_nodes_from_collision(value: bool)

  * bool get_exclude_nodes_from_collision()

If `true`, the two bodies bound together do not collide with each other.

NodePath node_a = `NodePath("")`

  * void set_node_a(value: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_node_a()

Path to the first node (A) attached to the joint. The node must inherit
PhysicsBody3D.

If left empty and node_b is set, the body is attached to a fixed StaticBody3D
without collision shapes.

NodePath node_b = `NodePath("")`

  * void set_node_b(value: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_node_b()

Path to the second node (B) attached to the joint. The node must inherit
PhysicsBody3D.

If left empty and node_a is set, the body is attached to a fixed StaticBody3D
without collision shapes.

int solver_priority = `1`

  * void set_solver_priority(value: int)

  * int get_solver_priority()

The priority used to define which solver is executed first for multiple
joints. The lower the value, the higher the priority.

## Method Descriptions

RID get_rid() const

Returns the joint's internal RID from the PhysicsServer3D.
