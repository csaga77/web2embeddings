# ResourceLoader

Inherits: Object

A singleton for loading resource files.

## Description

A singleton used to load resource files from the filesystem.

It uses the many ResourceFormatLoader classes registered in the engine (either
built-in or from a plugin) to load files into memory and convert them to a
format that can be used by the engine.

Note: You have to import the files into the engine first to load them using
load(). If you want to load Images at run-time, you may use Image.load(). If
you want to import audio files, you can use the snippet described in
AudioStreamMP3.data.

Note: Non-resource files such as plain text files cannot be read using
ResourceLoader. Use FileAccess for those files instead, and be aware that non-
resource files are not exported by default (see notes in the FileAccess class
description for instructions on exporting them).

## Enumerations

enum ThreadLoadStatus:

ThreadLoadStatus THREAD_LOAD_INVALID_RESOURCE = `0`

The resource is invalid, or has not been loaded with load_threaded_request().

ThreadLoadStatus THREAD_LOAD_IN_PROGRESS = `1`

The resource is still being loaded.

ThreadLoadStatus THREAD_LOAD_FAILED = `2`

Some error occurred during loading and it failed.

ThreadLoadStatus THREAD_LOAD_LOADED = `3`

The resource was loaded successfully and can be accessed via
load_threaded_get().

enum CacheMode:

CacheMode CACHE_MODE_IGNORE = `0`

Neither the main resource (the one requested to be loaded) nor any of its
subresources are retrieved from cache nor stored into it. Dependencies
(external resources) are loaded with CACHE_MODE_REUSE.

CacheMode CACHE_MODE_REUSE = `1`

The main resource (the one requested to be loaded), its subresources, and its
dependencies (external resources) are retrieved from cache if present, instead
of loaded. Those not cached are loaded and then stored into the cache. The
same rules are propagated recursively down the tree of dependencies (external
resources).

CacheMode CACHE_MODE_REPLACE = `2`

Like CACHE_MODE_REUSE, but the cache is checked for the main resource (the one
requested to be loaded) as well as for each of its subresources. Those already
in the cache, as long as the loaded and cached types match, have their data
refreshed from storage into the already existing instances. Otherwise, they
are recreated as completely new objects.

CacheMode CACHE_MODE_IGNORE_DEEP = `3`

Like CACHE_MODE_IGNORE, but propagated recursively down the tree of
dependencies (external resources).

CacheMode CACHE_MODE_REPLACE_DEEP = `4`

Like CACHE_MODE_REPLACE, but propagated recursively down the tree of
dependencies (external resources).

## Method Descriptions

void add_resource_format_loader(format_loader: ResourceFormatLoader, at_front:
bool = false)

Registers a new ResourceFormatLoader. The ResourceLoader will use the
ResourceFormatLoader as described in load().

This method is performed implicitly for ResourceFormatLoaders written in
GDScript (see ResourceFormatLoader for more information).

bool exists(path: String, type_hint: String = "")

Returns whether a recognized resource exists for the given `path`.

An optional `type_hint` can be used to further specify the Resource type that
should be handled by the ResourceFormatLoader. Anything that inherits from
Resource can be used as a type hint, for example Image.

Note: If you use Resource.take_over_path(), this method will return `true` for
the taken path even if the resource wasn't saved (i.e. exists only in resource
cache).

Resource get_cached_ref(path: String)

Returns the cached resource reference for the given `path`.

Note: If the resource is not cached, the returned Resource will be invalid.

PackedStringArray get_dependencies(path: String)

Returns the dependencies for the resource at the given `path`.

Note: The dependencies are returned with slices separated by `::`. You can use
String.get_slice() to get their components.

    
    
    for dependency in ResourceLoader.get_dependencies(path):
        print(dependency.get_slice("::", 0)) # Prints the UID.
        print(dependency.get_slice("::", 2)) # Prints the path.
    

PackedStringArray get_recognized_extensions_for_type(type: String)

Returns the list of recognized extensions for a resource type.

int get_resource_uid(path: String)

Returns the ID associated with a given resource path, or `-1` when no such ID
exists.

bool has_cached(path: String)

Returns whether a cached resource is available for the given `path`.

Once a resource has been loaded by the engine, it is cached in memory for
faster access, and future calls to the load() method will use the cached
version. The cached resource can be overridden by using
Resource.take_over_path() on a new resource for that same path.

PackedStringArray list_directory(directory_path: String)

Lists a directory (as example: "res://assets/enemies"), returning all
resources contained within. The resource files are the original file names as
visible in the editor before exporting.

Resource load(path: String, type_hint: String = "", cache_mode: CacheMode = 1)

Loads a resource at the given `path`, caching the result for further access.

The registered ResourceFormatLoaders are queried sequentially to find the
first one which can handle the file's extension, and then attempt loading. If
loading fails, the remaining ResourceFormatLoaders are also attempted.

An optional `type_hint` can be used to further specify the Resource type that
should be handled by the ResourceFormatLoader. Anything that inherits from
Resource can be used as a type hint, for example Image.

The `cache_mode` property defines whether and how the cache should be used or
updated when loading the resource. See CacheMode for details.

Returns an empty resource if no ResourceFormatLoader could handle the file,
and prints an error if no file is found at the specified path.

GDScript has a simplified @GDScript.load() built-in method which can be used
in most situations, leaving the use of ResourceLoader for more advanced
scenarios.

Note: If ProjectSettings.editor/export/convert_text_resources_to_binary is
`true`, @GDScript.load() will not be able to read converted files in an
exported project. If you rely on run-time loading of files present within the
PCK, set ProjectSettings.editor/export/convert_text_resources_to_binary to
`false`.

Note: Relative paths will be prefixed with `"res://"` before loading, to avoid
unexpected results make sure your paths are absolute.

Resource load_threaded_get(path: String)

Returns the resource loaded by load_threaded_request().

If this is called before the loading thread is done (i.e.
load_threaded_get_status() is not THREAD_LOAD_LOADED), the calling thread will
be blocked until the resource has finished loading. However, it's recommended
to use load_threaded_get_status() to known when the load has actually
completed.

ThreadLoadStatus load_threaded_get_status(path: String, progress: Array = [])

Returns the status of a threaded loading operation started with
load_threaded_request() for the resource at `path`. See ThreadLoadStatus for
possible return values.

An array variable can optionally be passed via `progress`, and will return a
one-element array containing the ratio of completion of the threaded loading
(between `0.0` and `1.0`).

Note: The recommended way of using this method is to call it during different
frames (e.g., in Node._process(), instead of a loop).

Error load_threaded_request(path: String, type_hint: String = "",
use_sub_threads: bool = false, cache_mode: CacheMode = 1)

Loads the resource using threads. If `use_sub_threads` is `true`, multiple
threads will be used to load the resource, which makes loading faster, but may
affect the main thread (and thus cause game slowdowns).

The `cache_mode` property defines whether and how the cache should be used or
updated when loading the resource. See CacheMode for details.

void remove_resource_format_loader(format_loader: ResourceFormatLoader)

Unregisters the given ResourceFormatLoader.

void set_abort_on_missing_resources(abort: bool)

Changes the behavior on missing sub-resources. The default behavior is to
abort loading.
