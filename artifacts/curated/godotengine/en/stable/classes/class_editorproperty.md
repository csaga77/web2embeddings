## Signals

multiple_properties_changed(properties: PackedStringArray, value: Array)

Emit it if you want multiple properties modified at the same time. Do not use
if added via EditorInspectorPlugin._parse_property().

object_id_selected(property: StringName, id: int)

Used by sub-inspectors. Emit it if what was selected was an Object ID.

property_can_revert_changed(property: StringName, can_revert: bool)

Emitted when the revertability (i.e., whether it has a non-default value and
thus is displayed with a revert icon) of a property has changed.

property_changed(property: StringName, value: Variant, field: StringName,
changing: bool)

Do not emit this manually, use the emit_changed() method instead.

property_checked(property: StringName, checked: bool)

Emitted when a property was checked. Used internally.

property_deleted(property: StringName)

Emitted when a property was deleted. Used internally.

property_favorited(property: StringName, favorited: bool)

Emit it if you want to mark a property as favorited, making it appear at the
top of the inspector.

property_keyed(property: StringName)

Emit it if you want to add this value as an animation key (check for keying
being enabled first).

property_keyed_with_value(property: StringName, value: Variant)

Emit it if you want to key a property with a single value.

property_pinned(property: StringName, pinned: bool)

Emit it if you want to mark (or unmark) the value of a property for being
saved regardless of being equal to the default value.

The default value is the one the property will get when the node is just
instantiated and can come from an ancestor scene in the
inheritance/instantiation chain, a script or a builtin class.

resource_selected(path: String, resource: Resource)

If you want a sub-resource to be edited, emit this signal with the resource.

selected(path: String, focusable_idx: int)

Emitted when selected. Used internally.

## Property Descriptions

bool checkable = `false`

  * void set_checkable(value: bool)

  * bool is_checkable()

Used by the inspector, set to `true` when the property is checkable.

bool checked = `false`

  * void set_checked(value: bool)

  * bool is_checked()

Used by the inspector, set to `true` when the property is checked.

bool deletable = `false`

  * void set_deletable(value: bool)

  * bool is_deletable()

Used by the inspector, set to `true` when the property can be deleted by the
user.

bool draw_background = `true`

  * void set_draw_background(value: bool)

  * bool is_draw_background()

Used by the inspector, set to `true` when the property label is drawn.

bool draw_label = `true`

  * void set_draw_label(value: bool)

  * bool is_draw_label()

Used by the inspector, set to `true` when the property background is drawn.

bool draw_warning = `false`

  * void set_draw_warning(value: bool)

  * bool is_draw_warning()

Used by the inspector, set to `true` when the property is drawn with the
editor theme's warning color. This is used for editable children's properties.

bool keying = `false`

  * void set_keying(value: bool)

  * bool is_keying()

Used by the inspector, set to `true` when the property can add keys for
animation.

String label = `""`

  * void set_label(value: String)

  * String get_label()

Set this property to change the label (if you want to show one).

float name_split_ratio = `0.5`

  * void set_name_split_ratio(value: float)

  * float get_name_split_ratio()

Space distribution ratio between the label and the editing field.

bool read_only = `false`

  * void set_read_only(value: bool)

  * bool is_read_only()

Used by the inspector, set to `true` when the property is read-only.

bool selectable = `true`

  * void set_selectable(value: bool)

  * bool is_selectable()

Used by the inspector, set to `true` when the property is selectable.

bool use_folding = `false`

  * void set_use_folding(value: bool)

  * bool is_using_folding()

Used by the inspector, set to `true` when the property is using folding.

## Method Descriptions

void _set_read_only(read_only: bool) virtual

Called when the read-only status of the property is changed. It may be used to
change custom controls into a read-only or modifiable state.

void _update_property() virtual

When this virtual function is called, you must update your editor.

void add_focusable(control: Control)

If any of the controls added can gain keyboard focus, add it here. This
ensures that focus will be restored if the inspector is refreshed.

void deselect()

Draw property as not selected. Used by the inspector.

void emit_changed(property: StringName, value: Variant, field: StringName =
&"", changing: bool = false)

If one or several properties have changed, this must be called. `field` is
used in case your editor can modify fields separately (as an example,
Vector3.x). The `changing` argument avoids the editor requesting this property
to be refreshed (leave as `false` if unsure).

Object get_edited_object()

Gets the edited object.

StringName get_edited_property() const

Gets the edited property. If your editor is for a single property (added via
EditorInspectorPlugin._parse_property()), then this will return the property.

bool is_selected() const

Returns `true` if property is drawn as selected. Used by the inspector.

void select(focusable: int = -1)

Draw property as selected. Used by the inspector.

void set_bottom_editor(editor: Control)

Puts the `editor` control below the property label. The control must be
previously added using Node.add_child().

void set_label_reference(control: Control)

Used by the inspector, set to a control that will be used as a reference to
calculate the size of the label.

void set_object_and_property(object: Object, property: StringName)

Assigns object and property to edit.

void update_property()

Forces refresh of the property display.
