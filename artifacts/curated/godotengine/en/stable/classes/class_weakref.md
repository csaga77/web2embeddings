# WeakRef

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Holds an Object. If the object is RefCounted, it doesn't update the reference
count.

## Description

A weakref can hold a RefCounted without contributing to the reference counter.
A weakref can be created from an Object using @GlobalScope.weakref(). If this
object is not a reference, weakref still works, however, it does not have any
effect on the object. Weakrefs are useful in cases where multiple classes have
variables that refer to each other. Without weakrefs, using these classes
could lead to memory leaks, since both references keep each other from being
released. Making part of the variables a weakref can prevent this cyclic
dependency, and allows the references to be released.
