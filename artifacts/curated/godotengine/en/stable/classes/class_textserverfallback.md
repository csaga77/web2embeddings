# TextServerFallback

Inherits: TextServerExtension < TextServer < RefCounted < Object

A fallback implementation of Godot's text server, without support for BiDi and
complex text layout.

## Description

A fallback implementation of Godot's text server. This fallback is faster than
TextServerAdvanced for processing a lot of text, but it does not support BiDi
and complex text layout.

Note: This text server is not part of official Godot binaries. If you want to
use it, compile the engine with the option
`module_text_server_fb_enabled=yes`. When building with TextServerFallback,
consider also disabling TextServerAdvanced with
`module_text_server_adv_enabled=no` to reduce binary size.
