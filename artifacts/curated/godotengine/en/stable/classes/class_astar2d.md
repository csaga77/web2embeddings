## Method Descriptions

float _compute_cost(from_id: int, to_id: int) virtual const

Called when computing the cost between two connected points.

Note that this function is hidden in the default AStar2D class.

float _estimate_cost(from_id: int, end_id: int) virtual const

Called when estimating the cost between a point and the path's ending point.

Note that this function is hidden in the default AStar2D class.

void add_point(id: int, position: Vector2, weight_scale: float = 1.0)

Adds a new point at the given position with the given identifier. The `id`
must be 0 or larger, and the `weight_scale` must be 0.0 or greater.

The `weight_scale` is multiplied by the result of _compute_cost() when
determining the overall cost of traveling across a segment from a neighboring
point to this point. Thus, all else being equal, the algorithm prefers points
with lower `weight_scale`s to form a path.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    var astar = AStar2D.new()
    astar.add_point(1, Vector2(1, 0), 4) # Adds the point (1, 0) with weight_scale 4 and id 1
    
    
    
    var astar = new AStar2D();
    astar.AddPoint(1, new Vector2(1, 0), 4); // Adds the point (1, 0) with weight_scale 4 and id 1
    

If there already exists a point for the given `id`, its position and weight
scale are updated to the given values.

bool are_points_connected(id: int, to_id: int, bidirectional: bool = true)
const

Returns whether there is a connection/segment between the given points. If
`bidirectional` is `false`, returns whether movement from `id` to `to_id` is
possible through this segment.

void clear()

Clears all the points and segments.

void connect_points(id: int, to_id: int, bidirectional: bool = true)

Creates a segment between the given points. If `bidirectional` is `false`,
only movement from `id` to `to_id` is allowed, not the reverse direction.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    var astar = AStar2D.new()
    astar.add_point(1, Vector2(1, 1))
    astar.add_point(2, Vector2(0, 5))
    astar.connect_points(1, 2, false)
    
    
    
    var astar = new AStar2D();
    astar.AddPoint(1, new Vector2(1, 1));
    astar.AddPoint(2, new Vector2(0, 5));
    astar.ConnectPoints(1, 2, false);
    

void disconnect_points(id: int, to_id: int, bidirectional: bool = true)

Deletes the segment between the given points. If `bidirectional` is `false`,
only movement from `id` to `to_id` is prevented, and a unidirectional segment
possibly remains.

int get_available_point_id() const

Returns the next available point ID with no point associated to it.

int get_closest_point(to_position: Vector2, include_disabled: bool = false)
const

Returns the ID of the closest point to `to_position`, optionally taking
disabled points into account. Returns `-1` if there are no points in the
points pool.

Note: If several points are the closest to `to_position`, the one with the
smallest ID will be returned, ensuring a deterministic result.

Vector2 get_closest_position_in_segment(to_position: Vector2) const

Returns the closest position to `to_position` that resides inside a segment
between two connected points.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    var astar = AStar2D.new()
    astar.add_point(1, Vector2(0, 0))
    astar.add_point(2, Vector2(0, 5))
    astar.connect_points(1, 2)
    var res = astar.get_closest_position_in_segment(Vector2(3, 3)) # Returns (0, 3)
    
    
    
    var astar = new AStar2D();
    astar.AddPoint(1, new Vector2(0, 0));
    astar.AddPoint(2, new Vector2(0, 5));
    astar.ConnectPoints(1, 2);
    Vector2 res = astar.GetClosestPositionInSegment(new Vector2(3, 3)); // Returns (0, 3)
    

The result is in the segment that goes from `y = 0` to `y = 5`. It's the
closest position in the segment to the given point.

PackedInt64Array get_id_path(from_id: int, to_id: int, allow_partial_path:
bool = false)

Returns an array with the IDs of the points that form the path found by
AStar2D between the given points. The array is ordered from the starting point
to the ending point of the path.

If there is no valid path to the target, and `allow_partial_path` is `true`,
returns a path to the point closest to the target that can be reached.

Note: When `allow_partial_path` is `true` and `to_id` is disabled the search
may take an unusually long time to finish.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    var astar = AStar2D.new()
    astar.add_point(1, Vector2(0, 0))
    astar.add_point(2, Vector2(0, 1), 1) # Default weight is 1
    astar.add_point(3, Vector2(1, 1))
    astar.add_point(4, Vector2(2, 0))
    
    astar.connect_points(1, 2, false)
    astar.connect_points(2, 3, false)
    astar.connect_points(4, 3, false)
    astar.connect_points(1, 4, false)
    
    var res = astar.get_id_path(1, 3) # Returns [1, 2, 3]
    
    
    
    var astar = new AStar2D();
    astar.AddPoint(1, new Vector2(0, 0));
    astar.AddPoint(2, new Vector2(0, 1), 1); // Default weight is 1
    astar.AddPoint(3, new Vector2(1, 1));
    astar.AddPoint(4, new Vector2(2, 0));
    
    astar.ConnectPoints(1, 2, false);
    astar.ConnectPoints(2, 3, false);
    astar.ConnectPoints(4, 3, false);
    astar.ConnectPoints(1, 4, false);
    long[] res = astar.GetIdPath(1, 3); // Returns [1, 2, 3]
    

If you change the 2nd point's weight to 3, then the result will be `[1, 4, 3]`
instead, because now even though the distance is longer, it's "easier" to get
through point 4 than through point 2.

int get_point_capacity() const

Returns the capacity of the structure backing the points, useful in
conjunction with reserve_space().

PackedInt64Array get_point_connections(id: int)

Returns an array with the IDs of the points that form the connection with the
given point.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    var astar = AStar2D.new()
    astar.add_point(1, Vector2(0, 0))
    astar.add_point(2, Vector2(0, 1))
    astar.add_point(3, Vector2(1, 1))
    astar.add_point(4, Vector2(2, 0))
    
    astar.connect_points(1, 2, true)
    astar.connect_points(1, 3, true)
    
    var neighbors = astar.get_point_connections(1) # Returns [2, 3]
    
    
    
    var astar = new AStar2D();
    astar.AddPoint(1, new Vector2(0, 0));
    astar.AddPoint(2, new Vector2(0, 1));
    astar.AddPoint(3, new Vector2(1, 1));
    astar.AddPoint(4, new Vector2(2, 0));
    
    astar.ConnectPoints(1, 2, true);
    astar.ConnectPoints(1, 3, true);
    
    long[] neighbors = astar.GetPointConnections(1); // Returns [2, 3]
    

int get_point_count() const

Returns the number of points currently in the points pool.

PackedInt64Array get_point_ids()

Returns an array of all point IDs.

PackedVector2Array get_point_path(from_id: int, to_id: int,
allow_partial_path: bool = false)

Returns an array with the points that are in the path found by AStar2D between
the given points. The array is ordered from the starting point to the ending
point of the path.

If there is no valid path to the target, and `allow_partial_path` is `true`,
returns a path to the point closest to the target that can be reached.

Note: This method is not thread-safe. If called from a Thread, it will return
an empty array and will print an error message.

Additionally, when `allow_partial_path` is `true` and `to_id` is disabled the
search may take an unusually long time to finish.

Vector2 get_point_position(id: int) const

Returns the position of the point associated with the given `id`.

float get_point_weight_scale(id: int) const

Returns the weight scale of the point associated with the given `id`.

bool has_point(id: int) const

Returns whether a point associated with the given `id` exists.

bool is_point_disabled(id: int) const

Returns whether a point is disabled or not for pathfinding. By default, all
points are enabled.

void remove_point(id: int)

Removes the point associated with the given `id` from the points pool.

void reserve_space(num_nodes: int)

Reserves space internally for `num_nodes` points. Useful if you're adding a
known large number of points at once, such as points on a grid. The new
capacity must be greater or equal to the old capacity.

void set_point_disabled(id: int, disabled: bool = true)

Disables or enables the specified point for pathfinding. Useful for making a
temporary obstacle.

void set_point_position(id: int, position: Vector2)

Sets the `position` for the point with the given `id`.

void set_point_weight_scale(id: int, weight_scale: float)

Sets the `weight_scale` for the point with the given `id`. The `weight_scale`
is multiplied by the result of _compute_cost() when determining the overall
cost of traveling across a segment from a neighboring point to this point.
