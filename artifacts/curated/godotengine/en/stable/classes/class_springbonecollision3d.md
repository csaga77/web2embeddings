# SpringBoneCollision3D

Inherits: Node3D < Node < Object

Inherited By: SpringBoneCollisionCapsule3D, SpringBoneCollisionPlane3D,
SpringBoneCollisionSphere3D

A base class of the collision that interacts with SpringBoneSimulator3D.

## Description

A collision can be a child of SpringBoneSimulator3D. If it is not a child of
SpringBoneSimulator3D, it has no effect.

The colliding and sliding are done in the SpringBoneSimulator3D's modification
process in order of its collision list which is set by
SpringBoneSimulator3D.set_collision_path(). If
SpringBoneSimulator3D.are_all_child_collisions_enabled() is `true`, the order
matches SceneTree.

If bone is set, it synchronizes with the bone pose of the ancestor Skeleton3D,
which is done in before the SpringBoneSimulator3D's modification process as
the pre-process.

Warning: A scaled SpringBoneCollision3D will likely not behave as expected.
Make sure that the parent Skeleton3D and its bones are not scaled.

## Properties

## Property Descriptions

int bone = `-1`

  * void set_bone(value: int)

  * int get_bone()

The index of the attached bone.

String bone_name = `""`

  * void set_bone_name(value: String)

  * String get_bone_name()

The name of the attached bone.

Vector3 position_offset

  * void set_position_offset(value: Vector3)

  * Vector3 get_position_offset()

The offset of the position from Skeleton3D's bone pose position.

Quaternion rotation_offset

  * void set_rotation_offset(value: Quaternion)

  * Quaternion get_rotation_offset()

The offset of the rotation from Skeleton3D's bone pose rotation.

## Method Descriptions

Skeleton3D get_skeleton() const

Get parent Skeleton3D node of the parent SpringBoneSimulator3D if found.
