A CSG Box shape.

## Description

This node allows you to create a box for use with the CSG system.

Note: CSG nodes are intended to be used for level prototyping. Creating CSG
nodes has a significant CPU cost compared to creating a MeshInstance3D with a
PrimitiveMesh. Moving a CSG node within another CSG node also has a
significant CPU cost, so it should be avoided during gameplay.
