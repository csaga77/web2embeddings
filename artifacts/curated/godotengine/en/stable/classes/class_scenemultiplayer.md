# SceneMultiplayer

Inherits: MultiplayerAPI < RefCounted < Object

High-level multiplayer API implementation.

## Description

This class is the default implementation of MultiplayerAPI, used to provide
multiplayer functionalities in Godot Engine.

This implementation supports RPCs via Node.rpc() and Node.rpc_id() and
requires MultiplayerAPI.rpc() to be passed a Node (it will fail for other
object types).

This implementation additionally provide SceneTree replication via the
MultiplayerSpawner and MultiplayerSynchronizer nodes, and the
SceneReplicationConfig resource.

Note: The high-level multiplayer API protocol is an implementation detail and
isn't meant to be used by non-Godot servers. It may change without notice.

Note: When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the `INTERNET` permission
in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click
deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by
Android.

## Signals

peer_authenticating(id: int)

Emitted when this MultiplayerAPI's MultiplayerAPI.multiplayer_peer connects to
a new peer and a valid auth_callback is set. In this case, the
MultiplayerAPI.peer_connected will not be emitted until complete_auth() is
called with given peer `id`. While in this state, the peer will not be
included in the list returned by MultiplayerAPI.get_peers() (but in the one
returned by get_authenticating_peers()), and only authentication data will be
sent or received. See send_auth() for sending authentication data.

peer_authentication_failed(id: int)

Emitted when this MultiplayerAPI's MultiplayerAPI.multiplayer_peer disconnects
from a peer for which authentication had not yet completed. See
peer_authenticating.

peer_packet(id: int, packet: PackedByteArray)

Emitted when this MultiplayerAPI's MultiplayerAPI.multiplayer_peer receives a
`packet` with custom data (see send_bytes()). ID is the peer ID of the peer
that sent the packet.

## Property Descriptions

bool allow_object_decoding = `false`

  * void set_allow_object_decoding(value: bool)

  * bool is_object_decoding_allowed()

If `true`, the MultiplayerAPI will allow encoding and decoding of object
during RPCs.

Warning: Deserialized objects can contain code which gets executed. Do not use
this option if the serialized object comes from untrusted sources to avoid
potential security threat such as remote code execution.

Callable auth_callback = `Callable()`

  * void set_auth_callback(value: Callable)

  * Callable get_auth_callback()

The callback to execute when receiving authentication data sent via
send_auth(). If the Callable is empty (default), peers will be automatically
accepted as soon as they connect.

float auth_timeout = `3.0`

  * void set_auth_timeout(value: float)

  * float get_auth_timeout()

If set to a value greater than `0.0`, the maximum duration in seconds peers
can stay in the authenticating state, after which the authentication will
automatically fail. See the peer_authenticating and peer_authentication_failed
signals.

int max_delta_packet_size = `65535`

  * void set_max_delta_packet_size(value: int)

  * int get_max_delta_packet_size()

Maximum size of each delta packet. Higher values increase the chance of
receiving full updates in a single frame, but also the chance of causing
networking congestion (higher latency, disconnections). See
MultiplayerSynchronizer.

int max_sync_packet_size = `1350`

  * void set_max_sync_packet_size(value: int)

  * int get_max_sync_packet_size()

Maximum size of each synchronization packet. Higher values increase the chance
of receiving full updates in a single frame, but also the chance of packet
loss. See MultiplayerSynchronizer.

bool refuse_new_connections = `false`

  * void set_refuse_new_connections(value: bool)

  * bool is_refusing_new_connections()

If `true`, the MultiplayerAPI's MultiplayerAPI.multiplayer_peer refuses new
incoming connections.

NodePath root_path = `NodePath("")`

  * void set_root_path(value: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_root_path()

The root path to use for RPCs and replication. Instead of an absolute path, a
relative path will be used to find the node upon which the RPC should be
executed.

This effectively allows to have different branches of the scene tree to be
managed by different MultiplayerAPI, allowing for example to run both client
and server in the same scene.

bool server_relay = `true`

  * void set_server_relay_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_server_relay_enabled()

Enable or disable the server feature that notifies clients of other peers'
connection/disconnection, and relays messages between them. When this option
is `false`, clients won't be automatically notified of other peers and won't
be able to send them packets through the server.

Note: Changing this option while other peers are connected may lead to
unexpected behaviors.

Note: Support for this feature may depend on the current MultiplayerPeer
configuration. See MultiplayerPeer.is_server_relay_supported().

## Method Descriptions

void clear()

Clears the current SceneMultiplayer network state (you shouldn't call this
unless you know what you are doing).

Error complete_auth(id: int)

Mark the authentication step as completed for the remote peer identified by
`id`. The MultiplayerAPI.peer_connected signal will be emitted for this peer
once the remote side also completes the authentication. No further
authentication messages are expected to be received from this peer.

If a peer disconnects before completing authentication, either due to a
network issue, the auth_timeout expiring, or manually calling
disconnect_peer(), the peer_authentication_failed signal will be emitted
instead of MultiplayerAPI.peer_disconnected.

void disconnect_peer(id: int)

Disconnects the peer identified by `id`, removing it from the list of
connected peers, and closing the underlying connection with it.

PackedInt32Array get_authenticating_peers()

Returns the IDs of the peers currently trying to authenticate with this
MultiplayerAPI.

Error send_auth(id: int, data: PackedByteArray)

Sends the specified `data` to the remote peer identified by `id` as part of an
authentication message. This can be used to authenticate peers, and control
when MultiplayerAPI.peer_connected is emitted (and the remote peer accepted as
one of the connected peers).

Error send_bytes(bytes: PackedByteArray, id: int = 0, mode: TransferMode = 2,
channel: int = 0)

Sends the given raw `bytes` to a specific peer identified by `id` (see
MultiplayerPeer.set_target_peer()). Default ID is `0`, i.e. broadcast to all
peers.
