# TextureRect

Inherits: Control < CanvasItem < Node < Object

A control that displays a texture.

## Description

A control that displays a texture, for example an icon inside a GUI. The
texture's placement can be controlled with the stretch_mode property. It can
scale, tile, or stay centered inside its bounding rectangle.

## Enumerations

enum ExpandMode:

ExpandMode EXPAND_KEEP_SIZE = `0`

The minimum size will be equal to texture size, i.e. TextureRect can't be
smaller than the texture.

ExpandMode EXPAND_IGNORE_SIZE = `1`

The size of the texture won't be considered for minimum size calculation, so
the TextureRect can be shrunk down past the texture size.

ExpandMode EXPAND_FIT_WIDTH = `2`

The height of the texture will be ignored. Minimum width will be equal to the
current height. Useful for horizontal layouts, e.g. inside HBoxContainer.

ExpandMode EXPAND_FIT_WIDTH_PROPORTIONAL = `3`

Same as EXPAND_FIT_WIDTH, but keeps texture's aspect ratio.

ExpandMode EXPAND_FIT_HEIGHT = `4`

The width of the texture will be ignored. Minimum height will be equal to the
current width. Useful for vertical layouts, e.g. inside VBoxContainer.

ExpandMode EXPAND_FIT_HEIGHT_PROPORTIONAL = `5`

Same as EXPAND_FIT_HEIGHT, but keeps texture's aspect ratio.

enum StretchMode:

StretchMode STRETCH_SCALE = `0`

Scale to fit the node's bounding rectangle.

StretchMode STRETCH_TILE = `1`

Tile inside the node's bounding rectangle.

StretchMode STRETCH_KEEP = `2`

The texture keeps its original size and stays in the bounding rectangle's top-
left corner.

StretchMode STRETCH_KEEP_CENTERED = `3`

The texture keeps its original size and stays centered in the node's bounding
rectangle.

StretchMode STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT = `4`

Scale the texture to fit the node's bounding rectangle, but maintain the
texture's aspect ratio.

StretchMode STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT_CENTERED = `5`

Scale the texture to fit the node's bounding rectangle, center it and maintain
its aspect ratio.

StretchMode STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT_COVERED = `6`

Scale the texture so that the shorter side fits the bounding rectangle. The
other side clips to the node's limits.

## Property Descriptions

ExpandMode expand_mode = `0`

  * void set_expand_mode(value: ExpandMode)

  * ExpandMode get_expand_mode()

Experimental: Using EXPAND_FIT_WIDTH, EXPAND_FIT_WIDTH_PROPORTIONAL,
EXPAND_FIT_HEIGHT, or EXPAND_FIT_HEIGHT_PROPORTIONAL may result in unstable
behavior in some Container controls. This behavior may be re-evaluated and
changed in the future.

Defines how minimum size is determined based on the texture's size. See
ExpandMode for options.

bool flip_h = `false`

  * void set_flip_h(value: bool)

  * bool is_flipped_h()

If `true`, texture is flipped horizontally.

bool flip_v = `false`

  * void set_flip_v(value: bool)

  * bool is_flipped_v()

If `true`, texture is flipped vertically.

StretchMode stretch_mode = `0`

  * void set_stretch_mode(value: StretchMode)

  * StretchMode get_stretch_mode()

Controls the texture's behavior when resizing the node's bounding rectangle.
See StretchMode.

Texture2D texture

  * void set_texture(value: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture()

The node's Texture2D resource.
