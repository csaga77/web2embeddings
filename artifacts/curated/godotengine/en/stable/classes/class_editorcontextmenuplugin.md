# EditorContextMenuPlugin

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Plugin for adding custom context menus in the editor.

## Description

EditorContextMenuPlugin allows for the addition of custom options in the
editor's context menu.

Currently, context menus are supported for three commonly used areas: the file
system, scene tree, and editor script list panel.

---|---  
void | add_context_menu_item(name: String, callback: Callable, icon: Texture2D = null)  
void | add_context_menu_item_from_shortcut(name: String, shortcut: Shortcut, icon: Texture2D = null)

void | add_menu_shortcut(shortcut: Shortcut, callback: Callable)  
  
## Enumerations

enum ContextMenuSlot:

ContextMenuSlot CONTEXT_SLOT_SCENE_TREE = `0`

Context menu of Scene dock. _popup_menu() will be called with a list of paths
to currently selected nodes, while option callback will receive the list of
currently selected nodes.

ContextMenuSlot CONTEXT_SLOT_FILESYSTEM = `1`

Context menu of FileSystem dock. _popup_menu() and option callback will be
called with list of paths of the currently selected files.

ContextMenuSlot CONTEXT_SLOT_SCRIPT_EDITOR = `2`

Context menu of Script editor's script tabs. _popup_menu() will be called with
the path to the currently edited script, while option callback will receive
reference to that script.

ContextMenuSlot CONTEXT_SLOT_FILESYSTEM_CREATE = `3`

The "Create..." submenu of FileSystem dock's context menu. _popup_menu() and
option callback will be called with list of paths of the currently selected
files.

ContextMenuSlot CONTEXT_SLOT_SCRIPT_EDITOR_CODE = `4`

Context menu of Script editor's code editor. _popup_menu() will be called with
the path to the CodeEdit node. You can fetch it using this code:

    
    
    func _popup_menu(paths):
        var code_edit = Engine.get_main_loop().root.get_node(paths[0]);
    

The option callback will receive reference to that node. You can use CodeEdit
methods to perform symbol lookups etc.

ContextMenuSlot CONTEXT_SLOT_SCENE_TABS = `5`

Context menu of scene tabs. _popup_menu() will be called with the path of the
clicked scene, or empty PackedStringArray if the menu was opened on empty
space. The option callback will receive the path of the clicked scene, or
empty String if none was clicked.

ContextMenuSlot CONTEXT_SLOT_2D_EDITOR = `6`

Context menu of 2D editor's basic right-click menu. _popup_menu() will be
called with paths to all CanvasItem nodes under the cursor. You can fetch them
using this code:

    
    
    func _popup_menu(paths):
        var canvas_item = Engine.get_main_loop().root.get_node(paths[0]); # Replace 0 with the desired index.
    

The paths array is empty if there weren't any nodes under cursor. The option
callback will receive a typed array of CanvasItem nodes.

## Method Descriptions

void _popup_menu(paths: PackedStringArray) virtual

Called when creating a context menu, custom options can be added by using the
add_context_menu_item() or add_context_menu_item_from_shortcut() functions.
`paths` contains currently selected paths (depending on menu), which can be
used to conditionally add options.

void add_context_menu_item(name: String, callback: Callable, icon: Texture2D =
null)

Add custom option to the context menu of the plugin's specified slot. When the
option is activated, `callback` will be called. Callback should take single
Array argument; array contents depend on context menu slot.

    
    
    func _popup_menu(paths):
        add_context_menu_item("File Custom options", handle, ICON)
    

If you want to assign shortcut to the menu item, use
add_context_menu_item_from_shortcut() instead.

void add_context_menu_item_from_shortcut(name: String, shortcut: Shortcut,
icon: Texture2D = null)

Add custom option to the context menu of the plugin's specified slot. The
option will have the `shortcut` assigned and reuse its callback. The shortcut
has to be registered beforehand with add_menu_shortcut().

    
    
    func _init():
        add_menu_shortcut(SHORTCUT, handle)
    
    func _popup_menu(paths):
        add_context_menu_item_from_shortcut("File Custom options", SHORTCUT, ICON)
    

void add_context_submenu_item(name: String, menu: PopupMenu, icon: Texture2D =
null)

Add a submenu to the context menu of the plugin's specified slot. The submenu
is not automatically handled, you need to connect to its signals yourself.
Also the submenu is freed on every popup, so provide a new PopupMenu every
time.

    
    
    func _popup_menu(paths):
        var popup_menu = PopupMenu.new()
        popup_menu.add_item("Blue")
        popup_menu.add_item("White")
        popup_menu.id_pressed.connect(_on_color_submenu_option)
    
        add_context_submenu_item("Set Node Color", popup_menu)
    

void add_menu_shortcut(shortcut: Shortcut, callback: Callable)

Registers a shortcut associated with the plugin's context menu. This method
should be called once (e.g. in plugin's Object._init()). `callback` will be
called when user presses the specified `shortcut` while the menu's context is
in effect (e.g. FileSystem dock is focused). Callback should take single Array
argument; array contents depend on context menu slot.

    
    
    func _init():
        add_menu_shortcut(SHORTCUT, handle)
