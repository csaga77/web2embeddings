Abstract base class for interacting with streams.

## Description

StreamPeer is an abstract base class mostly used for stream-based protocols
(such as TCP). It provides an API for sending and receiving data through
streams as raw data or strings.

Note: When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the `INTERNET` permission
in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click
deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by
Android.

## Property Descriptions

bool big_endian = `false`

  * void set_big_endian(value: bool)

  * bool is_big_endian_enabled()

If `true`, this StreamPeer will using big-endian format for encoding and
decoding.

## Method Descriptions

int get_8()

Gets a signed byte from the stream.

int get_16()

Gets a signed 16-bit value from the stream.

int get_32()

Gets a signed 32-bit value from the stream.

int get_64()

Gets a signed 64-bit value from the stream.

int get_available_bytes() const

Returns the number of bytes this StreamPeer has available.

Array get_data(bytes: int)

Returns a chunk data with the received bytes. The number of bytes to be
received can be requested in the `bytes` argument. If not enough bytes are
available, the function will block until the desired amount is received. This
function returns two values, an Error code and a data array.

float get_double()

Gets a double-precision float from the stream.

float get_float()

Gets a single-precision float from the stream.

float get_half()

Gets a half-precision float from the stream.

Array get_partial_data(bytes: int)

Returns a chunk data with the received bytes. The number of bytes to be
received can be requested in the "bytes" argument. If not enough bytes are
available, the function will return how many were actually received. This
function returns two values, an Error code, and a data array.

String get_string(bytes: int = -1)

Gets an ASCII string with byte-length `bytes` from the stream. If `bytes` is
negative (default) the length will be read from the stream using the reverse
process of put_string().

int get_u8()

Gets an unsigned byte from the stream.

int get_u16()

Gets an unsigned 16-bit value from the stream.

int get_u32()

Gets an unsigned 32-bit value from the stream.

int get_u64()

Gets an unsigned 64-bit value from the stream.

String get_utf8_string(bytes: int = -1)

Gets a UTF-8 string with byte-length `bytes` from the stream (this decodes the
string sent as UTF-8). If `bytes` is negative (default) the length will be
read from the stream using the reverse process of put_utf8_string().

Variant get_var(allow_objects: bool = false)

Gets a Variant from the stream. If `allow_objects` is `true`, decoding objects
is allowed.

Internally, this uses the same decoding mechanism as the
@GlobalScope.bytes_to_var() method.

Warning: Deserialized objects can contain code which gets executed. Do not use
this option if the serialized object comes from untrusted sources to avoid
potential security threats such as remote code execution.

void put_8(value: int)

Puts a signed byte into the stream.

void put_16(value: int)

Puts a signed 16-bit value into the stream.

void put_32(value: int)

Puts a signed 32-bit value into the stream.

void put_64(value: int)

Puts a signed 64-bit value into the stream.

Error put_data(data: PackedByteArray)

Sends a chunk of data through the connection, blocking if necessary until the
data is done sending. This function returns an Error code.

void put_double(value: float)

Puts a double-precision float into the stream.

void put_float(value: float)

Puts a single-precision float into the stream.

void put_half(value: float)

Puts a half-precision float into the stream.

Array put_partial_data(data: PackedByteArray)

Sends a chunk of data through the connection. If all the data could not be
sent at once, only part of it will. This function returns two values, an Error
code and an integer, describing how much data was actually sent.

void put_string(value: String)

Puts a zero-terminated ASCII string into the stream prepended by a 32-bit
unsigned integer representing its size.

Note: To put an ASCII string without prepending its size, you can use
put_data():

GDScriptC#

    
    
    put_data("Hello world".to_ascii_buffer())
    
    
    
    PutData("Hello World".ToAsciiBuffer());
    

void put_u8(value: int)

Puts an unsigned byte into the stream.

void put_u16(value: int)

Puts an unsigned 16-bit value into the stream.

void put_u32(value: int)

Puts an unsigned 32-bit value into the stream.

void put_u64(value: int)

Puts an unsigned 64-bit value into the stream.

void put_utf8_string(value: String)

Puts a zero-terminated UTF-8 string into the stream prepended by a 32 bits
unsigned integer representing its size.

Note: To put a UTF-8 string without prepending its size, you can use
put_data():

GDScriptC#

    
    
    put_data("Hello world".to_utf8_buffer())
    
    
    
    PutData("Hello World".ToUtf8Buffer());
    

void put_var(value: Variant, full_objects: bool = false)

Puts a Variant into the stream. If `full_objects` is `true` encoding objects
is allowed (and can potentially include code).

Internally, this uses the same encoding mechanism as the
@GlobalScope.var_to_bytes() method.
