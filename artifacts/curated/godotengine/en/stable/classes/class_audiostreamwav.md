# AudioStreamWAV

Inherits: AudioStream < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Stores audio data loaded from WAV files.

## Description

AudioStreamWAV stores sound samples loaded from WAV files. To play the stored
sound, use an AudioStreamPlayer (for non-positional audio) or
AudioStreamPlayer2D/AudioStreamPlayer3D (for positional audio). The sound can
be looped.

This class can also be used to store dynamically-generated PCM audio data. See
also AudioStreamGenerator for procedural audio generation.

## Enumerations

enum Format:

Format FORMAT_8_BITS = `0`

8-bit PCM audio codec.

Format FORMAT_16_BITS = `1`

16-bit PCM audio codec.

Format FORMAT_IMA_ADPCM = `2`

Audio is lossily compressed as IMA ADPCM.

Format FORMAT_QOA = `3`

Audio is lossily compressed as Quite OK Audio.

enum LoopMode:

LoopMode LOOP_DISABLED = `0`

Audio does not loop.

LoopMode LOOP_FORWARD = `1`

Audio loops the data between loop_begin and loop_end, playing forward only.

LoopMode LOOP_PINGPONG = `2`

Audio loops the data between loop_begin and loop_end, playing back and forth.

LoopMode LOOP_BACKWARD = `3`

Audio loops the data between loop_begin and loop_end, playing backward only.

## Property Descriptions

PackedByteArray data = `PackedByteArray()`

  * void set_data(value: PackedByteArray)

  * PackedByteArray get_data()

Contains the audio data in bytes.

Note: If format is set to FORMAT_8_BITS, this property expects signed 8-bit
PCM data. To convert from unsigned 8-bit PCM, subtract 128 from each byte.

Note: If format is set to FORMAT_QOA, this property expects data from a full
QOA file.

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedByteArray for more details.

Format format = `0`

  * void set_format(value: Format)

  * Format get_format()

Audio format. See Format constants for values.

int loop_begin = `0`

  * void set_loop_begin(value: int)

  * int get_loop_begin()

The loop start point (in number of samples, relative to the beginning of the
stream).

int loop_end = `0`

  * void set_loop_end(value: int)

  * int get_loop_end()

The loop end point (in number of samples, relative to the beginning of the
stream).

LoopMode loop_mode = `0`

  * void set_loop_mode(value: LoopMode)

  * LoopMode get_loop_mode()

The loop mode. See LoopMode constants for values.

int mix_rate = `44100`

  * void set_mix_rate(value: int)

  * int get_mix_rate()

The sample rate for mixing this audio. Higher values require more storage
space, but result in better quality.

In games, common sample rates in use are `11025`, `16000`, `22050`, `32000`,
`44100`, and `48000`.

According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, there is no quality
difference to human hearing when going past 40,000 Hz (since most humans can
only hear up to ~20,000 Hz, often less). If you are using lower-pitched sounds
such as voices, lower sample rates such as `32000` or `22050` may be usable
with no loss in quality.

bool stereo = `false`

  * void set_stereo(value: bool)

  * bool is_stereo()

If `true`, audio is stereo.

## Method Descriptions

AudioStreamWAV load_from_buffer(stream_data: PackedByteArray, options:
Dictionary = {}) static

Creates a new AudioStreamWAV instance from the given buffer. The buffer must
contain WAV data.

The keys and values of `options` match the properties of ResourceImporterWAV.
The usage of `options` is identical to load_from_file().

AudioStreamWAV load_from_file(path: String, options: Dictionary = {}) static

Creates a new AudioStreamWAV instance from the given file path. The file must
be in WAV format.

The keys and values of `options` match the properties of ResourceImporterWAV.

Example: Load the first file dropped as a WAV and play it:

    
    
    @onready var audio_player = $AudioStreamPlayer
    
    func _ready():
        get_window().files_dropped.connect(_on_files_dropped)
    
    func _on_files_dropped(files):
        if files[0].get_extension() == "wav":
            audio_player.stream = AudioStreamWAV.load_from_file(files[0], {
                    "force/max_rate": true,
                    "force/max_rate_hz": 11025
                })
            audio_player.play()
    

Error save_to_wav(path: String)

Saves the AudioStreamWAV as a WAV file to `path`. Samples with IMA ADPCM or
Quite OK Audio formats can't be saved.

Note: A `.wav` extension is automatically appended to `path` if it is missing.
