# Area2D

Inherits: CollisionObject2D < Node2D < CanvasItem < Node < Object

A region of 2D space that detects other CollisionObject2Ds entering or exiting
it.

## Description

Area2D is a region of 2D space defined by one or multiple CollisionShape2D or
CollisionPolygon2D child nodes. It detects when other CollisionObject2Ds enter
or exit it, and it also keeps track of which collision objects haven't exited
it yet (i.e. which one are overlapping it).

This node can also locally alter or override physics parameters (gravity,
damping) and route audio to custom audio buses.

Note: Areas and bodies created with PhysicsServer2D might not interact as
expected with Area2Ds, and might not emit signals or track objects correctly.

## Signals

area_entered(area: Area2D)

Emitted when the received `area` enters this area. Requires monitoring to be
set to `true`.

area_exited(area: Area2D)

Emitted when the received `area` exits this area. Requires monitoring to be
set to `true`.

area_shape_entered(area_rid: RID, area: Area2D, area_shape_index: int,
local_shape_index: int)

Emitted when a Shape2D of the received `area` enters a shape of this area.
Requires monitoring to be set to `true`.

`local_shape_index` and `area_shape_index` contain indices of the interacting
shapes from this area and the other area, respectively. `area_rid` contains
the RID of the other area. These values can be used with the PhysicsServer2D.

Example: Get the CollisionShape2D node from the shape index:

GDScript

    
    
    var other_shape_owner = area.shape_find_owner(area_shape_index)
    var other_shape_node = area.shape_owner_get_owner(other_shape_owner)
    
    var local_shape_owner = shape_find_owner(local_shape_index)
    var local_shape_node = shape_owner_get_owner(local_shape_owner)
    

area_shape_exited(area_rid: RID, area: Area2D, area_shape_index: int,
local_shape_index: int)

Emitted when a Shape2D of the received `area` exits a shape of this area.
Requires monitoring to be set to `true`.

See also area_shape_entered.

body_entered(body: Node2D)

Emitted when the received `body` enters this area. `body` can be a
PhysicsBody2D or a TileMap. TileMaps are detected if their TileSet has
collision shapes configured. Requires monitoring to be set to `true`.

body_exited(body: Node2D)

Emitted when the received `body` exits this area. `body` can be a
PhysicsBody2D or a TileMap. TileMaps are detected if their TileSet has

body_shape_entered(body_rid: RID, body: Node2D, body_shape_index: int,
local_shape_index: int)

Emitted when a Shape2D of the received `body` enters a shape of this area.
`body` can be a PhysicsBody2D or a TileMap. TileMaps are detected if their
TileSet has collision shapes configured. Requires monitoring to be set to
`true`.

`local_shape_index` and `body_shape_index` contain indices of the interacting
shapes from this area and the interacting body, respectively. `body_rid`
contains the RID of the body. These values can be used with the
PhysicsServer2D.

Example: Get the CollisionShape2D node from the shape index:

GDScript

    
    
    var body_shape_owner = body.shape_find_owner(body_shape_index)
    var body_shape_node = body.shape_owner_get_owner(body_shape_owner)
    
    var local_shape_owner = shape_find_owner(local_shape_index)
    var local_shape_node = shape_owner_get_owner(local_shape_owner)
    

body_shape_exited(body_rid: RID, body: Node2D, body_shape_index: int,

This area replaces any gravity/damping, even the defaults, ignoring any lower
priority areas.

SpaceOverride SPACE_OVERRIDE_REPLACE_COMBINE = `4`

## Property Descriptions

float angular_damp = `1.0`

  * void set_angular_damp(value: float)

  * float get_angular_damp()

The rate at which objects stop spinning in this area. Represents the angular
velocity lost per second.

See ProjectSettings.physics/2d/default_angular_damp for more details about
damping.

SpaceOverride angular_damp_space_override = `0`

  * void set_angular_damp_space_override_mode(value: SpaceOverride)

  * SpaceOverride get_angular_damp_space_override_mode()

Override mode for angular damping calculations within this area. See
SpaceOverride for possible values.

StringName audio_bus_name = `&"Master"`

  * void set_audio_bus_name(value: StringName)

  * StringName get_audio_bus_name()

The name of the area's audio bus.

bool audio_bus_override = `false`

  * void set_audio_bus_override(value: bool)

  * bool is_overriding_audio_bus()

If `true`, the area's audio bus overrides the default audio bus.

float gravity = `980.0`

  * void set_gravity(value: float)

  * float get_gravity()

The area's gravity intensity (in pixels per second squared). This value
multiplies the gravity direction. This is useful to alter the force of gravity
without altering its direction.

Vector2 gravity_direction = `Vector2(0, 1)`

  * void set_gravity_direction(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_gravity_direction()

The area's gravity vector (not normalized).

bool gravity_point = `false`

  * void set_gravity_is_point(value: bool)

  * bool is_gravity_a_point()

If `true`, gravity is calculated from a point (set via gravity_point_center).
See also gravity_space_override.

Vector2 gravity_point_center = `Vector2(0, 1)`

  * void set_gravity_point_center(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_gravity_point_center()

If gravity is a point (see gravity_point), this will be the point of
attraction.

float gravity_point_unit_distance = `0.0`

  * void set_gravity_point_unit_distance(value: float)

  * float get_gravity_point_unit_distance()

The distance at which the gravity strength is equal to gravity. For example,
on a planet 100 pixels in radius with a surface gravity of 4.0 px/s, set the
gravity to 4.0 and the unit distance to 100.0. The gravity will have falloff
according to the inverse square law, so in the example, at 200 pixels from the
center the gravity will be 1.0 px/s (twice the distance, 1/4th the gravity),
at 50 pixels it will be 16.0 px/s (half the distance, 4x the gravity), and so
on.

The above is true only when the unit distance is a positive number. When this
is set to 0.0, the gravity will be constant regardless of distance.

SpaceOverride gravity_space_override = `0`

  * void set_gravity_space_override_mode(value: SpaceOverride)

  * SpaceOverride get_gravity_space_override_mode()

Override mode for gravity calculations within this area. See SpaceOverride for
possible values.

float linear_damp = `0.1`

  * void set_linear_damp(value: float)

  * float get_linear_damp()

The rate at which objects stop moving in this area. Represents the linear
velocity lost per second.

See ProjectSettings.physics/2d/default_linear_damp for more details about
damping.

SpaceOverride linear_damp_space_override = `0`

  * void set_linear_damp_space_override_mode(value: SpaceOverride)

  * SpaceOverride get_linear_damp_space_override_mode()

Override mode for linear damping calculations within this area. See
SpaceOverride for possible values.

bool monitorable = `true`

  * void set_monitorable(value: bool)

  * bool is_monitorable()

If `true`, other monitoring areas can detect this area.

bool monitoring = `true`

  * void set_monitoring(value: bool)

  * bool is_monitoring()

If `true`, the area detects bodies or areas entering and exiting it.

int priority = `0`

  * void set_priority(value: int)

  * int get_priority()

The area's priority. Higher priority areas are processed first. The World2D's
physics is always processed last, after all areas.

## Method Descriptions

Array[Area2D] get_overlapping_areas() const

Returns a list of intersecting Area2Ds. The overlapping area's
CollisionObject2D.collision_layer must be part of this area's
CollisionObject2D.collision_mask in order to be detected.

For performance reasons (collisions are all processed at the same time) this
list is modified once during the physics step, not immediately after objects
are moved. Consider using signals instead.

Array[Node2D] get_overlapping_bodies() const

Returns a list of intersecting PhysicsBody2Ds and TileMaps. The overlapping
body's CollisionObject2D.collision_layer must be part of this area's
CollisionObject2D.collision_mask in order to be detected.

For performance reasons (collisions are all processed at the same time) this
list is modified once during the physics step, not immediately after objects
are moved. Consider using signals instead.

bool has_overlapping_areas() const

Returns `true` if intersecting any Area2Ds, otherwise returns `false`. The
overlapping area's CollisionObject2D.collision_layer must be part of this
area's CollisionObject2D.collision_mask in order to be detected.

For performance reasons (collisions are all processed at the same time) the
list of overlapping areas is modified once during the physics step, not
immediately after objects are moved. Consider using signals instead.

bool has_overlapping_bodies() const

Returns `true` if intersecting any PhysicsBody2Ds or TileMaps, otherwise
returns `false`. The overlapping body's CollisionObject2D.collision_layer must
be part of this area's CollisionObject2D.collision_mask in order to be
detected.

For performance reasons (collisions are all processed at the same time) the
list of overlapping bodies is modified once during the physics step, not
immediately after objects are moved. Consider using signals instead.

bool overlaps_area(area: Node) const

Returns `true` if the given Area2D intersects or overlaps this Area2D, `false`
otherwise.

Note: The result of this test is not immediate after moving objects. For
performance, the list of overlaps is updated once per frame and before the
physics step. Consider using signals instead.

bool overlaps_body(body: Node) const

Returns `true` if the given physics body intersects or overlaps this Area2D,
`false` otherwise.

Note: The result of this test is not immediate after moving objects. For
performance, list of overlaps is updated once per frame and before the physics
step. Consider using signals instead.

The `body` argument can either be a PhysicsBody2D or a TileMap instance. While
TileMaps are not physics bodies themselves, they register their tiles with
collision shapes as a virtual physics body.
