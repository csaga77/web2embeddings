# VideoStreamPlayback

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

Internal class used by VideoStream to manage playback state when played from a
VideoStreamPlayer.

## Description

This class is intended to be overridden by video decoder extensions with
custom implementations of VideoStream.

## Method Descriptions

int _get_channels() virtual const

Returns the number of audio channels.

float _get_length() virtual const

Returns the video duration in seconds, if known, or 0 if unknown.

int _get_mix_rate() virtual const

Returns the audio sample rate used for mixing.

float _get_playback_position() virtual const

Return the current playback timestamp. Called in response to the
VideoStreamPlayer.stream_position getter.

Texture2D _get_texture() virtual const

Allocates a Texture2D in which decoded video frames will be drawn.

bool _is_paused() virtual const

Returns the paused status, as set by _set_paused().

bool _is_playing() virtual const

Returns the playback state, as determined by calls to _play() and _stop().

void _play() virtual

Called in response to VideoStreamPlayer.autoplay or VideoStreamPlayer.play().
Note that manual playback may also invoke _stop() multiple times before this
method is called. _is_playing() should return `true` once playing.

void _seek(time: float) virtual

Seeks to `time` seconds. Called in response to the
VideoStreamPlayer.stream_position setter.

void _set_audio_track(idx: int) virtual

Select the audio track `idx`. Called when playback starts, and in response to
the VideoStreamPlayer.audio_track setter.

void _set_paused(paused: bool) virtual

Set the paused status of video playback. _is_paused() must return `paused`.
Called in response to the VideoStreamPlayer.paused setter.

void _stop() virtual

Stops playback. May be called multiple times before _play(), or in response to
VideoStreamPlayer.stop(). _is_playing() should return `false` once stopped.

void _update(delta: float) virtual

Ticks video playback for `delta` seconds. Called every frame as long as both
_is_paused() and _is_playing() return `true`.

int mix_audio(num_frames: int, buffer: PackedFloat32Array =
PackedFloat32Array(), offset: int = 0)

Render `num_frames` audio frames (of _get_channels() floats each) from
`buffer`, starting from index `offset` in the array. Returns the number of
audio frames rendered, or -1 on error.
