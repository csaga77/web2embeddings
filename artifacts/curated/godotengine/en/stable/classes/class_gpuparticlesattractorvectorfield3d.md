# GPUParticlesAttractorVectorField3D

Inherits: GPUParticlesAttractor3D < VisualInstance3D < Node3D < Node < Object

A box-shaped attractor with varying directions and strengths defined in it
that influences particles from GPUParticles3D nodes.

## Description

A box-shaped attractor with varying directions and strengths defined in it
that influences particles from GPUParticles3D nodes.

Unlike GPUParticlesAttractorBox3D, GPUParticlesAttractorVectorField3D uses a
texture to affect attraction strength within the box. This can be used to
create complex attraction scenarios where particles travel in different
directions depending on their location. This can be useful for weather effects
such as sandstorms.

Particle attractors work in real-time and can be moved, rotated and scaled
during gameplay. Unlike collision shapes, non-uniform scaling of attractors is
also supported.

Note: Particle attractors only affect GPUParticles3D, not CPUParticles3D.

## Properties

Vector3 | size | `Vector3(2, 2, 2)`

## Property Descriptions

Vector3 size = `Vector3(2, 2, 2)`

  * void set_size(value: Vector3)

  * Vector3 get_size()

The size of the vector field box in 3D units.

Texture3D texture

  * void set_texture(value: Texture3D)

  * Texture3D get_texture()

The 3D texture to be used. Values are linearly interpolated between the
texture's pixels.

Note: To get better performance, the 3D texture's resolution should reflect
the size of the attractor. Since particle attraction is usually low-frequency
data, the texture can be kept at a low resolution such as 646464.
