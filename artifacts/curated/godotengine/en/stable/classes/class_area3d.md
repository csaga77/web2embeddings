# Area3D

Inherits: CollisionObject3D < Node3D < Node < Object

A region of 3D space that detects other CollisionObject3Ds entering or exiting
it.

## Description

Area3D is a region of 3D space defined by one or multiple CollisionShape3D or
CollisionPolygon3D child nodes. It detects when other CollisionObject3Ds enter
or exit it, and it also keeps track of which collision objects haven't exited
it yet (i.e. which one are overlapping it).

This node can also locally alter or override physics parameters (gravity,
damping) and route audio to custom audio buses.

Note: Areas and bodies created with PhysicsServer3D might not interact as
expected with Area3Ds, and might not emit signals or track objects correctly.

Warning: Using a ConcavePolygonShape3D inside a CollisionShape3D child of this
node (created e.g. by using the Create Trimesh Collision Sibling option in the
Mesh menu that appears when selecting a MeshInstance3D node) may give
unexpected results, since this collision shape is hollow. If this is not
desired, it has to be split into multiple ConvexPolygonShape3Ds or primitive
shapes like BoxShape3D, or in some cases it may be replaceable by a
CollisionPolygon3D.

## Signals

area_entered(area: Area3D)

Emitted when the received `area` enters this area. Requires monitoring to be
set to `true`.

area_exited(area: Area3D)

Emitted when the received `area` exits this area. Requires monitoring to be
set to `true`.

area_shape_entered(area_rid: RID, area: Area3D, area_shape_index: int,
local_shape_index: int)

Emitted when a Shape3D of the received `area` enters a shape of this area.
Requires monitoring to be set to `true`.

`local_shape_index` and `area_shape_index` contain indices of the interacting

the RID of the other area. These values can be used with the PhysicsServer3D.

Example: Get the CollisionShape3D node from the shape index:

GDScript

    
    
    var other_shape_owner = area.shape_find_owner(area_shape_index)
    var other_shape_node = area.shape_owner_get_owner(other_shape_owner)
    
    var local_shape_owner = shape_find_owner(local_shape_index)
    var local_shape_node = shape_owner_get_owner(local_shape_owner)

## Property Descriptions

float angular_damp = `0.1`

  * void set_angular_damp(value: float)

  * float get_angular_damp()

The rate at which objects stop spinning in this area. Represents the angular
velocity lost per second.

See ProjectSettings.physics/3d/default_angular_damp for more details about
damping.

SpaceOverride angular_damp_space_override = `0`

  * void set_angular_damp_space_override_mode(value: SpaceOverride)

  * SpaceOverride get_angular_damp_space_override_mode()

Override mode for angular damping calculations within this area. See
SpaceOverride for possible values.

StringName audio_bus_name = `&"Master"`

  * void set_audio_bus_name(value: StringName)

  * StringName get_audio_bus_name()

The name of the area's audio bus.

bool audio_bus_override = `false`

  * void set_audio_bus_override(value: bool)

  * bool is_overriding_audio_bus()

If `true`, the area's audio bus overrides the default audio bus.

float gravity = `9.8`

  * void set_gravity(value: float)

  * float get_gravity()

The area's gravity intensity (in meters per second squared). This value
multiplies the gravity direction. This is useful to alter the force of gravity
without altering its direction.

Vector3 gravity_direction = `Vector3(0, -1, 0)`

  * void set_gravity_direction(value: Vector3)

  * Vector3 get_gravity_direction()

The area's gravity vector (not normalized).

bool gravity_point = `false`

  * void set_gravity_is_point(value: bool)

  * bool is_gravity_a_point()

If `true`, gravity is calculated from a point (set via gravity_point_center).
See also gravity_space_override.

Vector3 gravity_point_center = `Vector3(0, -1, 0)`

  * void set_gravity_point_center(value: Vector3)

  * Vector3 get_gravity_point_center()

If gravity is a point (see gravity_point), this will be the point of
attraction.

float gravity_point_unit_distance = `0.0`

  * void set_gravity_point_unit_distance(value: float)

  * float get_gravity_point_unit_distance()

The distance at which the gravity strength is equal to gravity. For example,
on a planet 100 meters in radius with a surface gravity of 4.0 m/s, set the
gravity to 4.0 and the unit distance to 100.0. The gravity will have falloff
according to the inverse square law, so in the example, at 200 meters from the
center the gravity will be 1.0 m/s (twice the distance, 1/4th the gravity), at
50 meters it will be 16.0 m/s (half the distance, 4x the gravity), and so on.

The above is true only when the unit distance is a positive number. When this
is set to 0.0, the gravity will be constant regardless of distance.

SpaceOverride gravity_space_override = `0`

physics is always processed last, after all areas.

float reverb_bus_amount = `0.0`

  * void set_reverb_amount(value: float)

origin.

Note: This wind force only applies to SoftBody3D nodes. Other physics bodies
are currently not affected by wind.

float wind_force_magnitude = `0.0`

  * void set_wind_force_magnitude(value: float)

  * float get_wind_force_magnitude()

The magnitude of area-specific wind force.

Note: This wind force only applies to SoftBody3D nodes. Other physics bodies
are currently not affected by wind.

NodePath wind_source_path = `NodePath("")`

  * void set_wind_source_path(value: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_wind_source_path()

The Node3D which is used to specify the direction and origin of an area-
specific wind force. The direction is opposite to the z-axis of the Node3D's
local transform, and its origin is the origin of the Node3D's local transform.

Note: This wind force only applies to SoftBody3D nodes. Other physics bodies
are currently not affected by wind.

## Method Descriptions

Array[Area3D] get_overlapping_areas() const

Returns a list of intersecting Area3Ds. The overlapping area's
CollisionObject3D.collision_layer must be part of this area's
CollisionObject3D.collision_mask in order to be detected.

For performance reasons (collisions are all processed at the same time) this
list is modified once during the physics step, not immediately after objects
are moved. Consider using signals instead.

Array[Node3D] get_overlapping_bodies() const

Returns a list of intersecting PhysicsBody3Ds and GridMaps. The overlapping
body's CollisionObject3D.collision_layer must be part of this area's
CollisionObject3D.collision_mask in order to be detected.

For performance reasons (collisions are all processed at the same time) this
list is modified once during the physics step, not immediately after objects
are moved. Consider using signals instead.

bool has_overlapping_areas() const

Returns `true` if intersecting any Area3Ds, otherwise returns `false`. The
overlapping area's CollisionObject3D.collision_layer must be part of this
area's CollisionObject3D.collision_mask in order to be detected.

For performance reasons (collisions are all processed at the same time) the
list of overlapping areas is modified once during the physics step, not
immediately after objects are moved. Consider using signals instead.

bool has_overlapping_bodies() const

Returns `true` if intersecting any PhysicsBody3Ds or GridMaps, otherwise
returns `false`. The overlapping body's CollisionObject3D.collision_layer must
be part of this area's CollisionObject3D.collision_mask in order to be
detected.

For performance reasons (collisions are all processed at the same time) the
list of overlapping bodies is modified once during the physics step, not
immediately after objects are moved. Consider using signals instead.

bool overlaps_area(area: Node) const

Returns `true` if the given Area3D intersects or overlaps this Area3D, `false`
otherwise.

Note: The result of this test is not immediate after moving objects. For
performance, list of overlaps is updated once per frame and before the physics
step. Consider using signals instead.

bool overlaps_body(body: Node) const

Returns `true` if the given physics body intersects or overlaps this Area3D,
`false` otherwise.

Note: The result of this test is not immediate after moving objects. For
performance, list of overlaps is updated once per frame and before the physics
step. Consider using signals instead.

The `body` argument can either be a PhysicsBody3D or a GridMap instance. While
GridMaps are not physics body themselves, they register their tiles with
collision shapes as a virtual physics body.
