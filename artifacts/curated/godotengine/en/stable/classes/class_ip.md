# IP

Inherits: Object

Internet protocol (IP) support functions such as DNS resolution.

## Description

IP contains support functions for the Internet Protocol (IP). TCP/IP support
is in different classes (see StreamPeerTCP and TCPServer). IP provides DNS
hostname resolution support, both blocking and threaded.

## Enumerations

enum ResolverStatus:

ResolverStatus RESOLVER_STATUS_NONE = `0`

DNS hostname resolver status: No status.

ResolverStatus RESOLVER_STATUS_WAITING = `1`

DNS hostname resolver status: Waiting.

ResolverStatus RESOLVER_STATUS_DONE = `2`

DNS hostname resolver status: Done.

ResolverStatus RESOLVER_STATUS_ERROR = `3`

DNS hostname resolver status: Error.

enum Type:

Type TYPE_NONE = `0`

Address type: None.

Type TYPE_IPV4 = `1`

Address type: Internet protocol version 4 (IPv4).

Type TYPE_IPV6 = `2`

Address type: Internet protocol version 6 (IPv6).

Type TYPE_ANY = `3`

Address type: Any.

## Constants

RESOLVER_MAX_QUERIES = `256`

Maximum number of concurrent DNS resolver queries allowed, RESOLVER_INVALID_ID
is returned if exceeded.

RESOLVER_INVALID_ID = `-1`

Invalid ID constant. Returned if RESOLVER_MAX_QUERIES is exceeded.

## Method Descriptions

void clear_cache(hostname: String = "")

Removes all of a `hostname`'s cached references. If no `hostname` is given,
all cached IP addresses are removed.

void erase_resolve_item(id: int)

Removes a given item `id` from the queue. This should be used to free a queue
after it has completed to enable more queries to happen.

PackedStringArray get_local_addresses() const

Returns all the user's current IPv4 and IPv6 addresses as an array.

Array[Dictionary] get_local_interfaces() const

Returns all network adapters as an array.

Each adapter is a dictionary of the form:

    
    
    {
        "index": "1", # Interface index.
        "name": "eth0", # Interface name.
        "friendly": "Ethernet One", # A friendly name (might be empty).
        "addresses": ["192.168.1.101"], # An array of IP addresses associated to this interface.
    }
    

String get_resolve_item_address(id: int) const

Returns a queued hostname's IP address, given its queue `id`. Returns an empty
string on error or if resolution hasn't happened yet (see
get_resolve_item_status()).

Array get_resolve_item_addresses(id: int) const

Returns resolved addresses, or an empty array if an error happened or
resolution didn't happen yet (see get_resolve_item_status()).

ResolverStatus get_resolve_item_status(id: int) const

Returns a queued hostname's status as a ResolverStatus constant, given its
queue `id`.

String resolve_hostname(host: String, ip_type: Type = 3)

Returns a given hostname's IPv4 or IPv6 address when resolved (blocking-type
method). The address type returned depends on the Type constant given as
`ip_type`.

PackedStringArray resolve_hostname_addresses(host: String, ip_type: Type = 3)

Resolves a given hostname in a blocking way. Addresses are returned as an
Array of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses depending on `ip_type`.

int resolve_hostname_queue_item(host: String, ip_type: Type = 3)

Creates a queue item to resolve a hostname to an IPv4 or IPv6 address
depending on the Type constant given as `ip_type`. Returns the queue ID if
successful, or RESOLVER_INVALID_ID on error.
