# Line2D

Inherits: Node2D < CanvasItem < Node < Object

A 2D polyline that can optionally be textured.

## Description

This node draws a 2D polyline, i.e. a shape consisting of several points
connected by segments. Line2D is not a mathematical polyline, i.e. the
segments are not infinitely thin. It is intended for rendering and it can be
colored and optionally textured.

Warning: Certain configurations may be impossible to draw nicely, such as very
sharp angles. In these situations, the node uses fallback drawing logic to
look decent.

Note: Line2D is drawn using a 2D mesh.

## Enumerations

enum LineJointMode:

LineJointMode LINE_JOINT_SHARP = `0`

Makes the polyline's joints pointy, connecting the sides of the two segments
by extending them until they intersect. If the rotation of a joint is too big
(based on sharp_limit), the joint falls back to LINE_JOINT_BEVEL to prevent
very long miters.

LineJointMode LINE_JOINT_BEVEL = `1`

Makes the polyline's joints bevelled/chamfered, connecting the sides of the
two segments with a simple line.

LineJointMode LINE_JOINT_ROUND = `2`

Makes the polyline's joints rounded, connecting the sides of the two segments
with an arc. The detail of this arc depends on round_precision.

enum LineCapMode:

LineCapMode LINE_CAP_NONE = `0`

Draws no line cap.

LineCapMode LINE_CAP_BOX = `1`

Draws the line cap as a box, slightly extending the first/last segment.

LineCapMode LINE_CAP_ROUND = `2`

Draws the line cap as a semicircle attached to the first/last segment.

enum LineTextureMode:

LineTextureMode LINE_TEXTURE_NONE = `0`

Takes the left pixels of the texture and renders them over the whole polyline.

LineTextureMode LINE_TEXTURE_TILE = `1`

Tiles the texture over the polyline. CanvasItem.texture_repeat of the Line2D
node must be CanvasItem.TEXTURE_REPEAT_ENABLED or
CanvasItem.TEXTURE_REPEAT_MIRROR for it to work properly.

LineTextureMode LINE_TEXTURE_STRETCH = `2`

Stretches the texture across the polyline. CanvasItem.texture_repeat of the
Line2D node must be CanvasItem.TEXTURE_REPEAT_DISABLED for best results.

## Property Descriptions

bool antialiased = `false`

  * void set_antialiased(value: bool)

  * bool get_antialiased()

If `true`, the polyline's border will be anti-aliased.

Note: Line2D is not accelerated by batching when being anti-aliased.

LineCapMode begin_cap_mode = `0`

  * void set_begin_cap_mode(value: LineCapMode)

  * LineCapMode get_begin_cap_mode()

The style of the beginning of the polyline, if closed is `false`. Use
LineCapMode constants.

bool closed = `false`

  * void set_closed(value: bool)

  * bool is_closed()

If `true` and the polyline has more than 2 points, the last point and the
first one will be connected by a segment.

Note: The shape of the closing segment is not guaranteed to be seamless if a
width_curve is provided.

Note: The joint between the closing segment and the first segment is drawn
first and it samples the gradient and the width_curve at the beginning. This
is an implementation detail that might change in a future version.

Color default_color = `Color(1, 1, 1, 1)`

  * void set_default_color(value: Color)

  * Color get_default_color()

The color of the polyline. Will not be used if a gradient is set.

LineCapMode end_cap_mode = `0`

  * void set_end_cap_mode(value: LineCapMode)

  * LineCapMode get_end_cap_mode()

The style of the end of the polyline, if closed is `false`. Use LineCapMode
constants.

Gradient gradient

  * void set_gradient(value: Gradient)

  * Gradient get_gradient()

The gradient is drawn through the whole line from start to finish. The
default_color will not be used if this property is set.

LineJointMode joint_mode = `0`

  * void set_joint_mode(value: LineJointMode)

  * LineJointMode get_joint_mode()

The style of the connections between segments of the polyline. Use
LineJointMode constants.

PackedVector2Array points = `PackedVector2Array()`

  * void set_points(value: PackedVector2Array)

  * PackedVector2Array get_points()

The points of the polyline, interpreted in local 2D coordinates. Segments are
drawn between the adjacent points in this array.

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedVector2Array for more details.

int round_precision = `8`

  * void set_round_precision(value: int)

  * int get_round_precision()

The smoothness used for rounded joints and caps. Higher values result in
smoother corners, but are more demanding to render and update.

float sharp_limit = `2.0`

  * void set_sharp_limit(value: float)

  * float get_sharp_limit()

Determines the miter limit of the polyline. Normally, when joint_mode is set
to LINE_JOINT_SHARP, sharp angles fall back to using the logic of
LINE_JOINT_BEVEL joints to prevent very long miters. Higher values of this
property mean that the fallback to a bevel joint will happen at sharper
angles.

Texture2D texture

  * void set_texture(value: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture()

The texture used for the polyline. Uses texture_mode for drawing style.

LineTextureMode texture_mode = `0`

  * void set_texture_mode(value: LineTextureMode)

  * LineTextureMode get_texture_mode()

The style to render the texture of the polyline. Use LineTextureMode
constants.

float width = `10.0`

  * void set_width(value: float)

  * float get_width()

The polyline's width.

Curve width_curve

  * void set_curve(value: Curve)

  * Curve get_curve()

The polyline's width curve. The width of the polyline over its length will be
equivalent to the value of the width curve over its domain. The width curve
should be a unit Curve.

## Method Descriptions

void add_point(position: Vector2, index: int = -1)

Adds a point with the specified `position` relative to the polyline's own
position. If no `index` is provided, the new point will be added to the end of
the points array.

If `index` is given, the new point is inserted before the existing point
identified by index `index`. The indices of the points after the new point get
increased by 1. The provided `index` must not exceed the number of existing
points in the polyline. See get_point_count().

void clear_points()

Removes all points from the polyline, making it empty.

int get_point_count() const

Returns the number of points in the polyline.

Vector2 get_point_position(index: int) const

Returns the position of the point at index `index`.

void remove_point(index: int)

Removes the point at index `index` from the polyline.

void set_point_position(index: int, position: Vector2)

Overwrites the position of the point at the given `index` with the supplied
`position`.
