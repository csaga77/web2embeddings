# Thread

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

A unit of execution in a process.

## Description

A unit of execution in a process. Can run methods on Objects simultaneously.
The use of synchronization via Mutex or Semaphore is advised if working with
shared objects.

Warning:

To ensure proper cleanup without crashes or deadlocks, when a Thread's
reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed, the following
conditions must be met:

  * It must not have any Mutex objects locked.

  * It must not be waiting on any Semaphore objects.

  * wait_to_finish() should have been called on it.

  * Using multiple threads

  * Thread-safe APIs

## Enumerations

enum Priority:

Priority PRIORITY_LOW = `0`

A thread running with lower priority than normally.

Priority PRIORITY_NORMAL = `1`

A thread with a standard priority.

Priority PRIORITY_HIGH = `2`

A thread running with higher priority than normally.

## Method Descriptions

String get_id() const

Returns the current Thread's ID, uniquely identifying it among all threads. If
the Thread has not started running or if wait_to_finish() has been called,
this returns an empty string.

bool is_alive() const

Returns `true` if this Thread is currently running the provided function. This
is useful for determining if wait_to_finish() can be called without blocking
the calling thread.

To check if a Thread is joinable, use is_started().

bool is_started() const

Returns `true` if this Thread has been started. Once started, this will return
`true` until it is joined using wait_to_finish(). For checking if a Thread is
still executing its task, use is_alive().

void set_thread_safety_checks_enabled(enabled: bool) static

Sets whether the thread safety checks the engine normally performs in methods
of certain classes (e.g., Node) should happen on the current thread.

The default, for every thread, is that they are enabled (as if called with
`enabled` being `true`).

Those checks are conservative. That means that they will only succeed in
considering a call thread-safe (and therefore allow it to happen) if the
engine can guarantee such safety.

Because of that, there may be cases where the user may want to disable them
(`enabled` being `false`) to make certain operations allowed again. By doing
so, it becomes the user's responsibility to ensure thread safety (e.g., by
using Mutex) for those objects that are otherwise protected by the engine.

Note: This is an advanced usage of the engine. You are advised to use it only
if you know what you are doing and there is no safer way.

Note: This is useful for scripts running on either arbitrary Thread objects or
tasks submitted to the WorkerThreadPool. It doesn't apply to code running
during Node group processing, where the checks will be always performed.

Note: Even in the case of having disabled the checks in a WorkerThreadPool
task, there's no need to re-enable them at the end. The engine will do so.

Error start(callable: Callable, priority: Priority = 1)

Starts a new Thread that calls `callable`.

If the method takes some arguments, you can pass them using Callable.bind().

The `priority` of the Thread can be changed by passing a value from the
Priority enum.

Returns @GlobalScope.OK on success, or @GlobalScope.ERR_CANT_CREATE on
failure.

Variant wait_to_finish()

Joins the Thread and waits for it to finish. Returns the output of the
Callable passed to start().

Should either be used when you want to retrieve the value returned from the
method called by the Thread or before freeing the instance that contains the
Thread.

To determine if this can be called without blocking the calling thread, check
if is_alive() is `false`.

Built with Sphinx using a theme provided by Read the Docs.

  *[const]: This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.
  *[void]: No return value.
  *[static]: This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.
