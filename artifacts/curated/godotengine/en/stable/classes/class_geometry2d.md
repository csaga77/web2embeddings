## Enumerations

enum PolyBooleanOperation:

PolyBooleanOperation OPERATION_UNION = `0`

Create regions where either subject or clip polygons (or both) are filled.

PolyBooleanOperation OPERATION_DIFFERENCE = `1`

Create regions where subject polygons are filled except where clip polygons
are filled.

PolyBooleanOperation OPERATION_INTERSECTION = `2`

Create regions where both subject and clip polygons are filled.

PolyBooleanOperation OPERATION_XOR = `3`

Create regions where either subject or clip polygons are filled but not where
both are filled.

enum PolyJoinType:

PolyJoinType JOIN_SQUARE = `0`

Squaring is applied uniformally at all convex edge joins at `1 * delta`.

PolyJoinType JOIN_ROUND = `1`

While flattened paths can never perfectly trace an arc, they are approximated
by a series of arc chords.

PolyJoinType JOIN_MITER = `2`

There's a necessary limit to mitered joins since offsetting edges that join at
very acute angles will produce excessively long and narrow "spikes". For any
given edge join, when miter offsetting would exceed that maximum distance,
"square" joining is applied.

enum PolyEndType:

PolyEndType END_POLYGON = `0`

Endpoints are joined using the PolyJoinType value and the path filled as a
polygon.

PolyEndType END_JOINED = `1`

Endpoints are joined using the PolyJoinType value and the path filled as a
polyline.

PolyEndType END_BUTT = `2`

Endpoints are squared off with no extension.

PolyEndType END_SQUARE = `3`

Endpoints are squared off and extended by `delta` units.

PolyEndType END_ROUND = `4`

Endpoints are rounded off and extended by `delta` units.

## Method Descriptions

Array[Vector2i] bresenham_line(from: Vector2i, to: Vector2i)

Returns the Bresenham line between the `from` and `to` points. A Bresenham
line is a series of pixels that draws a line and is always 1-pixel thick on
every row and column of the drawing (never more, never less).

Example code to draw a line between two Marker2D nodes using a series of
CanvasItem.draw_rect() calls:

    
    
    func _draw():
        for pixel in Geometry2D.bresenham_line($MarkerA.position, $MarkerB.position):
            draw_rect(Rect2(pixel, Vector2.ONE), Color.WHITE)
    

Array[PackedVector2Array] clip_polygons(polygon_a: PackedVector2Array,
polygon_b: PackedVector2Array)

Clips `polygon_a` against `polygon_b` and returns an array of clipped
polygons. This performs OPERATION_DIFFERENCE between polygons. Returns an
empty array if `polygon_b` completely overlaps `polygon_a`.

If `polygon_b` is enclosed by `polygon_a`, returns an outer polygon (boundary)
and inner polygon (hole) which could be distinguished by calling
is_polygon_clockwise().

Array[PackedVector2Array] clip_polyline_with_polygon(polyline:
PackedVector2Array, polygon: PackedVector2Array)

Clips `polyline` against `polygon` and returns an array of clipped polylines.
This performs OPERATION_DIFFERENCE between the polyline and the polygon. This
operation can be thought of as cutting a line with a closed shape.

PackedVector2Array convex_hull(points: PackedVector2Array)

Given an array of Vector2s, returns the convex hull as a list of points in
counterclockwise order. The last point is the same as the first one.

Array[PackedVector2Array] decompose_polygon_in_convex(polygon:
PackedVector2Array)

Decomposes the `polygon` into multiple convex hulls and returns an array of
PackedVector2Array.

Array[PackedVector2Array] exclude_polygons(polygon_a: PackedVector2Array,
polygon_b: PackedVector2Array)

Mutually excludes common area defined by intersection of `polygon_a` and
`polygon_b` (see intersect_polygons()) and returns an array of excluded
polygons. This performs OPERATION_XOR between polygons. In other words,
returns all but common area between polygons.

The operation may result in an outer polygon (boundary) and inner polygon
(hole) produced which could be distinguished by calling
is_polygon_clockwise().

Vector2 get_closest_point_to_segment(point: Vector2, s1: Vector2, s2: Vector2)

Returns the 2D point on the 2D segment (`s1`, `s2`) that is closest to
`point`. The returned point will always be inside the specified segment.

Vector2 get_closest_point_to_segment_uncapped(point: Vector2, s1: Vector2, s2:
Vector2)

Returns the 2D point on the 2D line defined by (`s1`, `s2`) that is closest to
`point`. The returned point can be inside the segment (`s1`, `s2`) or outside
of it, i.e. somewhere on the line extending from the segment.

PackedVector2Array get_closest_points_between_segments(p1: Vector2, q1:
Vector2, p2: Vector2, q2: Vector2)

Given the two 2D segments (`p1`, `q1`) and (`p2`, `q2`), finds those two
points on the two segments that are closest to each other. Returns a
PackedVector2Array that contains this point on (`p1`, `q1`) as well the
accompanying point on (`p2`, `q2`).

Array[PackedVector2Array] intersect_polygons(polygon_a: PackedVector2Array,
polygon_b: PackedVector2Array)

Intersects `polygon_a` with `polygon_b` and returns an array of intersected
polygons. This performs OPERATION_INTERSECTION between polygons. In other
words, returns common area shared by polygons. Returns an empty array if no
intersection occurs.

The operation may result in an outer polygon (boundary) and inner polygon
(hole) produced which could be distinguished by calling
is_polygon_clockwise().

Array[PackedVector2Array] intersect_polyline_with_polygon(polyline:
PackedVector2Array, polygon: PackedVector2Array)

Intersects `polyline` with `polygon` and returns an array of intersected
polylines. This performs OPERATION_INTERSECTION between the polyline and the
polygon. This operation can be thought of as chopping a line with a closed
shape.

bool is_point_in_circle(point: Vector2, circle_position: Vector2,
circle_radius: float)

Returns `true` if `point` is inside the circle or if it's located exactly on
the circle's boundary, otherwise returns `false`.

bool is_point_in_polygon(point: Vector2, polygon: PackedVector2Array)

Returns `true` if `point` is inside `polygon` or if it's located exactly on
polygon's boundary, otherwise returns `false`.

bool is_polygon_clockwise(polygon: PackedVector2Array)

Returns `true` if `polygon`'s vertices are ordered in clockwise order,
otherwise returns `false`.

Note: Assumes a Cartesian coordinate system where `+x` is right and `+y` is
up. If using screen coordinates (`+y` is down), the result will need to be
flipped (i.e. a `true` result will indicate counter-clockwise).

Variant line_intersects_line(from_a: Vector2, dir_a: Vector2, from_b: Vector2,
dir_b: Vector2)

Returns the point of intersection between the two lines (`from_a`, `dir_a`)
and (`from_b`, `dir_b`). Returns a Vector2, or `null` if the lines are
parallel.

`from` and `dir` are not endpoints of a line segment or ray but the slope
(`dir`) and a known point (`from`) on that line.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    var from_a = Vector2.ZERO
    var dir_a = Vector2.RIGHT
    var from_b = Vector2.DOWN
    
    # Returns Vector2(1, 0)
    Geometry2D.line_intersects_line(from_a, dir_a, from_b, Vector2(1, -1))
    # Returns Vector2(-1, 0)
    Geometry2D.line_intersects_line(from_a, dir_a, from_b, Vector2(-1, -1))
    # Returns null
    Geometry2D.line_intersects_line(from_a, dir_a, from_b, Vector2.RIGHT)
    
    
    
    var fromA = Vector2.Zero;
    var dirA = Vector2.Right;
    var fromB = Vector2.Down;
    
    // Returns new Vector2(1, 0)
    Geometry2D.LineIntersectsLine(fromA, dirA, fromB, new Vector2(1, -1));
    // Returns new Vector2(-1, 0)
    Geometry2D.LineIntersectsLine(fromA, dirA, fromB, new Vector2(-1, -1));
    // Returns null
    Geometry2D.LineIntersectsLine(fromA, dirA, fromB, Vector2.Right);
    

Dictionary make_atlas(sizes: PackedVector2Array)

Given an array of Vector2s representing tiles, builds an atlas. The returned
dictionary has two keys: `points` is a PackedVector2Array that specifies the
positions of each tile, `size` contains the overall size of the whole atlas as
Vector2i.

Array[PackedVector2Array] merge_polygons(polygon_a: PackedVector2Array,
polygon_b: PackedVector2Array)

Merges (combines) `polygon_a` and `polygon_b` and returns an array of merged
polygons. This performs OPERATION_UNION between polygons.

The operation may result in an outer polygon (boundary) and multiple inner
polygons (holes) produced which could be distinguished by calling
is_polygon_clockwise().

Array[PackedVector2Array] offset_polygon(polygon: PackedVector2Array, delta:
float, join_type: PolyJoinType = 0)

Inflates or deflates `polygon` by `delta` units (pixels). If `delta` is
positive, makes the polygon grow outward. If `delta` is negative, shrinks the
polygon inward. Returns an array of polygons because inflating/deflating may
result in multiple discrete polygons. Returns an empty array if `delta` is
negative and the absolute value of it approximately exceeds the minimum
bounding rectangle dimensions of the polygon.

Each polygon's vertices will be rounded as determined by `join_type`, see
PolyJoinType.

The operation may result in an outer polygon (boundary) and inner polygon
(hole) produced which could be distinguished by calling
is_polygon_clockwise().

Note: To translate the polygon's vertices specifically, multiply them to a
Transform2D:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    var polygon = PackedVector2Array([Vector2(0, 0), Vector2(100, 0), Vector2(100, 100), Vector2(0, 100)])
    var offset = Vector2(50, 50)
    polygon = Transform2D(0, offset) * polygon
    print(polygon) # Prints [(50.0, 50.0), (150.0, 50.0), (150.0, 150.0), (50.0, 150.0)]
    
    
    
    Vector2[] polygon = [new Vector2(0, 0), new Vector2(100, 0), new Vector2(100, 100), new Vector2(0, 100)];
    var offset = new Vector2(50, 50);
    polygon = new Transform2D(0, offset) * polygon;
    GD.Print((Variant)polygon); // Prints [(50, 50), (150, 50), (150, 150), (50, 150)]
    

Array[PackedVector2Array] offset_polyline(polyline: PackedVector2Array, delta:
float, join_type: PolyJoinType = 0, end_type: PolyEndType = 3)

Inflates or deflates `polyline` by `delta` units (pixels), producing polygons.
If `delta` is positive, makes the polyline grow outward. Returns an array of
polygons because inflating/deflating may result in multiple discrete polygons.
If `delta` is negative, returns an empty array.

Each polygon's vertices will be rounded as determined by `join_type`, see
PolyJoinType.

Each polygon's endpoints will be rounded as determined by `end_type`, see
PolyEndType.

The operation may result in an outer polygon (boundary) and inner polygon
(hole) produced which could be distinguished by calling
is_polygon_clockwise().

bool point_is_inside_triangle(point: Vector2, a: Vector2, b: Vector2, c:
Vector2) const

Returns if `point` is inside the triangle specified by `a`, `b` and `c`.

float segment_intersects_circle(segment_from: Vector2, segment_to: Vector2,
circle_position: Vector2, circle_radius: float)

Given the 2D segment (`segment_from`, `segment_to`), returns the position on
the segment (as a number between 0 and 1) at which the segment hits the circle
that is located at position `circle_position` and has radius `circle_radius`.
If the segment does not intersect the circle, -1 is returned (this is also the
case if the line extending the segment would intersect the circle, but the
segment does not).

Variant segment_intersects_segment(from_a: Vector2, to_a: Vector2, from_b:
Vector2, to_b: Vector2)

Checks if the two segments (`from_a`, `to_a`) and (`from_b`, `to_b`)
intersect. If yes, return the point of intersection as Vector2. If no
intersection takes place, returns `null`.

PackedInt32Array triangulate_delaunay(points: PackedVector2Array)

Triangulates the area specified by discrete set of `points` such that no point
is inside the circumcircle of any resulting triangle. Returns a
PackedInt32Array where each triangle consists of three consecutive point
indices into `points` (i.e. the returned array will have `n * 3` elements,
with `n` being the number of found triangles). If the triangulation did not
succeed, an empty PackedInt32Array is returned.

PackedInt32Array triangulate_polygon(polygon: PackedVector2Array)

Triangulates the polygon specified by the points in `polygon`. Returns a
PackedInt32Array where each triangle consists of three consecutive point
indices into `polygon` (i.e. the returned array will have `n * 3` elements,
with `n` being the number of found triangles). Output triangles will always be
counter clockwise, and the contour will be flipped if it's clockwise. If the
triangulation did not succeed, an empty PackedInt32Array is returned.
