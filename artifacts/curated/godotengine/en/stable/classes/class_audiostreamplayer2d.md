# AudioStreamPlayer2D

Inherits: Node2D < CanvasItem < Node < Object

Plays positional sound in 2D space.

## Description

Plays audio that is attenuated with distance to the listener.

By default, audio is heard from the screen center. This can be changed by
adding an AudioListener2D node to the scene and enabling it by calling
AudioListener2D.make_current() on it.

See also AudioStreamPlayer to play a sound non-positionally.

Note: Hiding an AudioStreamPlayer2D node does not disable its audio output. To
temporarily disable an AudioStreamPlayer2D's audio output, set volume_db to a
very low value like `-100` (which isn't audible to human hearing).

## Property Descriptions

int area_mask = `1`

  * void set_area_mask(value: int)

  * int get_area_mask()

Determines which Area2D layers affect the sound for reverb and audio bus
effects. Areas can be used to redirect AudioStreams so that they play in a
certain audio bus. An example of how you might use this is making a "water"
area so that sounds played in the water are redirected through an audio bus to
make them sound like they are being played underwater.

float attenuation = `1.0`

  * void set_attenuation(value: float)

  * float get_attenuation()

The volume is attenuated over distance with this as an exponent.

bool autoplay = `false`

  * void set_autoplay(value: bool)

  * bool is_autoplay_enabled()

If `true`, audio plays when added to scene tree.

StringName bus = `&"Master"`

  * void set_bus(value: StringName)

  * StringName get_bus()

Bus on which this audio is playing.

Note: When setting this property, keep in mind that no validation is performed
to see if the given name matches an existing bus. This is because audio bus
layouts might be loaded after this property is set. If this given name can't
be resolved at runtime, it will fall back to `"Master"`.

float max_distance = `2000.0`

  * void set_max_distance(value: float)

  * float get_max_distance()

Maximum distance from which audio is still hearable.

int max_polyphony = `1`

  * void set_max_polyphony(value: int)

  * int get_max_polyphony()

The maximum number of sounds this node can play at the same time. Playing
additional sounds after this value is reached will cut off the oldest sounds.

float panning_strength = `1.0`

  * void set_panning_strength(value: float)

  * float get_panning_strength()

Scales the panning strength for this node by multiplying the base
ProjectSettings.audio/general/2d_panning_strength with this factor. Higher
values will pan audio from left to right more dramatically than lower values.

float pitch_scale = `1.0`

  * void set_pitch_scale(value: float)

  * float get_pitch_scale()

The pitch and the tempo of the audio, as a multiplier of the audio sample's
sample rate.

PlaybackType playback_type = `0`

  * void set_playback_type(value: PlaybackType)

  * PlaybackType get_playback_type()

Experimental: This property may be changed or removed in future versions.

The playback type of the stream player. If set other than to the default
value, it will force that playback type.

bool playing = `false`

  * void set_playing(value: bool)

  * bool is_playing()

If `true`, audio is playing or is queued to be played (see play()).

AudioStream stream

  * void set_stream(value: AudioStream)

  * AudioStream get_stream()

The AudioStream object to be played.

bool stream_paused = `false`

  * void set_stream_paused(value: bool)

  * bool get_stream_paused()

If `true`, the playback is paused. You can resume it by setting stream_paused
to `false`.

float volume_db = `0.0`

  * void set_volume_db(value: float)

  * float get_volume_db()

Base volume before attenuation, in decibels.

float volume_linear

  * void set_volume_linear(value: float)

  * float get_volume_linear()

Base volume before attenuation, as a linear value.

Note: This member modifies volume_db for convenience. The returned value is
equivalent to the result of @GlobalScope.db_to_linear() on volume_db. Setting
this member is equivalent to setting volume_db to the result of
@GlobalScope.linear_to_db() on a value.

## Method Descriptions

float get_playback_position()

Returns the position in the AudioStream.

AudioStreamPlayback get_stream_playback()

Returns the AudioStreamPlayback object associated with this
AudioStreamPlayer2D.

bool has_stream_playback()

Returns whether the AudioStreamPlayer can return the AudioStreamPlayback
object or not.

void play(from_position: float = 0.0)

Queues the audio to play on the next physics frame, from the given position
`from_position`, in seconds.

void seek(to_position: float)

Sets the position from which audio will be played, in seconds.

void stop()

Stops the audio.
