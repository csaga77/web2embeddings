# GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D

Inherits: GPUParticlesCollision3D < VisualInstance3D < Node3D < Node < Object

A real-time heightmap-shaped 3D particle collision shape affecting
GPUParticles3D nodes.

## Description

A real-time heightmap-shaped 3D particle collision shape affecting
GPUParticles3D nodes.

Heightmap shapes allow for efficiently representing collisions for convex and
concave objects with a single "floor" (such as terrain). This is less flexible
than GPUParticlesCollisionSDF3D, but it doesn't require a baking step.

GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D can also be regenerated in real-time when
it is moved, when the camera moves, or even continuously. This makes
GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D a good choice for weather effects such as
rain and snow and games with highly dynamic geometry. However, this class is
limited since heightmaps cannot represent overhangs (e.g. indoors or caves).

Note: ParticleProcessMaterial.collision_mode must be `true` on the
GPUParticles3D's process material for collision to work.

Note: Particle collision only affects GPUParticles3D, not CPUParticles3D.

## Enumerations

enum Resolution:

Resolution RESOLUTION_256 = `0`

Generate a 256256 heightmap. Intended for small-scale scenes, or larger scenes
with no distant particles.

Resolution RESOLUTION_512 = `1`

Generate a 512512 heightmap. Intended for medium-scale scenes, or larger
scenes with no distant particles.

Resolution RESOLUTION_1024 = `2`

Generate a 10241024 heightmap. Intended for large scenes with distant
particles.

Resolution RESOLUTION_2048 = `3`

Generate a 20482048 heightmap. Intended for very large scenes with distant
particles.

Resolution RESOLUTION_4096 = `4`

Generate a 40964096 heightmap. Intended for huge scenes with distant
particles.

Resolution RESOLUTION_8192 = `5`

Generate a 81928192 heightmap. Intended for gigantic scenes with distant
particles.

Resolution RESOLUTION_MAX = `6`

Represents the size of the Resolution enum.

enum UpdateMode:

UpdateMode UPDATE_MODE_WHEN_MOVED = `0`

Only update the heightmap when the GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D node is
moved, or when the camera moves if follow_camera_enabled is `true`. An update
can be forced by slightly moving the GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D in any
direction, or by calling
RenderingServer.particles_collision_height_field_update().

UpdateMode UPDATE_MODE_ALWAYS = `1`

Update the heightmap every frame. This has a significant performance cost.
This update should only be used when geometry that particles can collide with
changes significantly during gameplay.

## Property Descriptions

bool follow_camera_enabled = `false`

  * void set_follow_camera_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_follow_camera_enabled()

If `true`, the GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D will follow the current
camera in global space. The GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D does not need
to be a child of the Camera3D node for this to work.

Following the camera has a performance cost, as it will force the heightmap to
update whenever the camera moves. Consider lowering resolution to improve
performance if follow_camera_enabled is `true`.

int heightfield_mask = `1048575`

  * void set_heightfield_mask(value: int)

  * int get_heightfield_mask()

The visual layers to account for when updating the heightmap. Only
MeshInstance3Ds whose VisualInstance3D.layers match with this heightfield_mask
will be included in the heightmap collision update. By default, all 20 user-
visible layers are taken into account for updating the heightmap collision.

Note: Since the heightfield_mask allows for 32 layers to be stored in total,
there are an additional 12 layers that are only used internally by the engine
and aren't exposed in the editor. Setting heightfield_mask using a script
allows you to toggle those reserved layers, which can be useful for editor
plugins.

To adjust heightfield_mask more easily using a script, use
get_heightfield_mask_value() and set_heightfield_mask_value().

Resolution resolution = `2`

  * void set_resolution(value: Resolution)

  * Resolution get_resolution()

Higher resolutions can represent small details more accurately in large
scenes, at the cost of lower performance. If update_mode is
UPDATE_MODE_ALWAYS, consider using the lowest resolution possible.

Vector3 size = `Vector3(2, 2, 2)`

  * void set_size(value: Vector3)

  * Vector3 get_size()

The collision heightmap's size in 3D units. To improve heightmap quality, size
should be set as small as possible while covering the parts of the scene you
need.

UpdateMode update_mode = `0`

  * void set_update_mode(value: UpdateMode)

  * UpdateMode get_update_mode()

The update policy to use for the generated heightmap.

## Method Descriptions

bool get_heightfield_mask_value(layer_number: int) const

Returns `true` if the specified layer of the heightfield_mask is enabled,
given a `layer_number` between `1` and `20`, inclusive.

void set_heightfield_mask_value(layer_number: int, value: bool)

Based on `value`, enables or disables the specified layer in the
heightfield_mask, given a `layer_number` between `1` and `20`, inclusive.
