## Properties

int | create_from | `0`  
---|---|---  
float | threshold | `0.5`  
  
## Property Descriptions

int create_from = `0`

The data source to use for generating the bitmap.

Black & White: Pixels whose HSV value is greater than the threshold will be
considered as "enabled" (bit is `true`). If the pixel is lower than or equal
to the threshold, it will be considered as "disabled" (bit is `false`).

Alpha: Pixels whose alpha value is greater than the threshold will be
considered as "enabled" (bit is `true`). If the pixel is lower than or equal
to the threshold, it will be considered as "disabled" (bit is `false`).

float threshold = `0.5`

The threshold to use to determine which bits should be considered enabled or
disabled. See also create_from.
