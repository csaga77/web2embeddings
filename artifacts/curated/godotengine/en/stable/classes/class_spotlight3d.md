# SpotLight3D

Inherits: Light3D < VisualInstance3D < Node3D < Node < Object

A spotlight, such as a reflector spotlight or a lantern.

## Description

A Spotlight is a type of Light3D node that emits lights in a specific
direction, in the shape of a cone. The light is attenuated through the
distance. This attenuation can be configured by changing the energy, radius
and attenuation parameters of Light3D.

Note: When using the Mobile rendering method, only 8 spot lights can be
displayed on each mesh resource. Attempting to display more than 8 spot lights
on a single mesh resource will result in spot lights flickering in and out as
the camera moves. When using the Compatibility rendering method, only 8 spot
lights can be displayed on each mesh resource by default, but this can be
increased by adjusting
ProjectSettings.rendering/limits/opengl/max_lights_per_object.

Note: When using the Mobile or Compatibility rendering methods, spot lights
will only correctly affect meshes whose visibility AABB intersects with the
light's AABB. If using a shader to deform the mesh in a way that makes it go
outside its AABB, GeometryInstance3D.extra_cull_margin must be increased on
the mesh. Otherwise, the light may not be visible on the mesh.

float | spot_range | `5.0`  
  
## Property Descriptions

float spot_angle = `45.0`

  * void set_param(value: float)

  * float get_param()

The spotlight's angle in degrees.

Note: spot_angle is not affected by Node3D.scale (the light's scale or its
parent's scale).

float spot_angle_attenuation = `1.0`

  * void set_param(value: float)

  * float get_param()

The spotlight's angular attenuation curve. See also spot_attenuation.

float spot_attenuation = `1.0`

  * void set_param(value: float)

  * float get_param()

Controls the distance attenuation function for spotlights.

A value of `0.0` will maintain a constant brightness through most of the
range, but smoothly attenuate the light at the edge of the range. Use a value
of `2.0` for physically accurate lights as it results in the proper inverse
square attenutation.

Note: Setting attenuation to `2.0` or higher may result in distant objects
receiving minimal light, even within range. For example, with a range of
`4096`, an object at `100` units is attenuated by a factor of `0.0001`. With a
default brightness of `1`, the light would not be visible at that distance.

Note: Using negative or values higher than `10.0` may lead to unexpected
results.

float spot_range = `5.0`

  * void set_param(value: float)

  * float get_param()

The maximal range that can be reached by the spotlight. Note that the
effectively lit area may appear to be smaller depending on the
spot_attenuation in use. No matter the spot_attenuation in use, the light will
never reach anything outside this range.

Note: spot_range is not affected by Node3D.scale (the light's scale or its
parent's scale).
