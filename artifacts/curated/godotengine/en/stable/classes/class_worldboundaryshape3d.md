# WorldBoundaryShape3D

Inherits: Shape3D < Resource < RefCounted < Object

A 3D world boundary (half-space) shape used for physics collision.

## Description

A 3D world boundary shape, intended for use in physics. WorldBoundaryShape3D
works like an infinite plane that forces all physics bodies to stay above it.
The plane's normal determines which direction is considered as "above" and in
the editor, the line over the plane represents this direction. It can for
example be used for endless flat floors.

Note: When the physics engine is set to Jolt Physics in the project settings
(ProjectSettings.physics/3d/physics_engine), WorldBoundaryShape3D has a finite
size (centered at the shape's origin). It can be adjusted by changing
ProjectSettings.physics/jolt_physics_3d/limits/world_boundary_shape_size.

## Properties
