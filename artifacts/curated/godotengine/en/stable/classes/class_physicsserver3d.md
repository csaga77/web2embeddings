# PhysicsServer3D

Inherits: Object

Inherited By: PhysicsServer3DExtension

A server interface for low-level 3D physics access.

## Description

PhysicsServer3D is the server responsible for all 3D physics. It can directly
create and manipulate all physics objects:

  * A space is a self-contained world for a physics simulation. It contains bodies, areas, and joints. Its state can be queried for collision and intersection information, and several parameters of the simulation can be modified.

  * A shape is a geometric shape such as a sphere, a box, a cylinder, or a polygon. It can be used for collision detection by adding it to a body/area, possibly with an extra transformation relative to the body/area's origin. Bodies/areas can have multiple (transformed) shapes added to them, and a single shape can be added to bodies/areas multiple times with different local transformations.

  * A body is a physical object which can be in static, kinematic, or rigid mode. Its state (such as position and velocity) can be queried and updated. A force integration callback can be set to customize the body's physics.

  * An area is a region in space which can be used to detect bodies and areas entering and exiting it. A body monitoring callback can be set to report entering/exiting body shapes, and similarly an area monitoring callback can be set. Gravity and damping can be overridden within the area by setting area parameters.

  * A joint is a constraint, either between two bodies or on one body relative to a point. Parameters such as the joint bias and the rest length of a spring joint can be adjusted.

Physics objects in PhysicsServer3D may be created and manipulated
independently; they do not have to be tied to nodes in the scene tree.

Note: All the 3D physics nodes use the physics server internally. Adding a
physics node to the scene tree will cause a corresponding physics object to be
created in the physics server. A rigid body node registers a callback that
updates the node's transform with the transform of the respective body object
in the physics server (every physics update). An area node registers a
callback to inform the area node about overlaps with the respective area
object in the physics server. The raycast node queries the direct state of the
relevant space in the physics server.

Constant to set/get whether the gravity vector of an area is a direction, or a
center point.

AreaParameter AREA_PARAM_GRAVITY_POINT_UNIT_DISTANCE = `4`

Constant to set/get the distance at which the gravity strength is equal to the
gravity controlled by AREA_PARAM_GRAVITY. For example, on a planet 100 meters
in radius with a surface gravity of 4.0 m/s, set the gravity to 4.0 and the
unit distance to 100.0. The gravity will have falloff according to the inverse
square law, so in the example, at 200 meters from the center the gravity will
be 1.0 m/s (twice the distance, 1/4th the gravity), at 50 meters it will be
16.0 m/s (half the distance, 4x the gravity), and so on.

void body_set_force_integration_callback(body: RID, callable: Callable,
userdata: Variant = null)

Sets the body's custom force integration callback function to `callable`. Use
an empty Callable (`Callable()`) to clear the custom callback.

The function `callable` will be called every physics tick, before the standard
force integration (see body_set_omit_force_integration()). It can be used for
example to update the body's linear and angular velocity based on contact with
other bodies.

If `userdata` is not `null`, the function `callable` must take the following
two parameters:

  1. `state`: a PhysicsDirectBodyState3D, used to retrieve and modify the body's state,

  2. `userdata`: a Variant; its value will be the `userdata` passed into this method.

If `userdata` is `null`, then `callable` must take only the `state` parameter.

void body_set_max_contacts_reported(body: RID, amount: int)

with other bodies. This is enabled by setting the maximum number of contacts

damping to update the body's linear and angular velocity. In this case,
body_set_force_integration_callback() can be used to manually update the
linear and angular velocity instead.

This method is called when the property RigidBody3D.custom_integrator is set.

Sets a body parameter. A list of available parameters is on the BodyParameter
constants.

Sets a body state (see BodyState constants).

void body_set_state_sync_callback(body: RID, callable: Callable)

Sets the body's state synchronization callback function to `callable`. Use an
empty Callable (`Callable()`) to clear the callback.

The function `callable` will be called every physics frame, assuming that the
body was active during the previous physics tick, and can be used to fetch the
latest state from the physics server.

The function `callable` must take the following parameters:

  1. `state`: a PhysicsDirectBodyState3D, used to retrieve the body's state.

bool body_test_motion(body: RID, parameters: PhysicsTestMotionParameters3D,
result: PhysicsTestMotionResult3D = null)

Returns `true` if a collision would result from moving along a motion vector
from a given point in space. PhysicsTestMotionParameters3D is passed to set
motion parameters. PhysicsTestMotionResult3D can be passed to return
additional information.
