## Property Descriptions

String application/company_name

Company that produced the application. Required. See StringFileInfo.

String application/console_wrapper_icon

Console wrapper icon file. If left empty, it will fallback to
application/icon, then to
ProjectSettings.application/config/windows_native_icon, and lastly,
ProjectSettings.application/config/icon.

String application/copyright

Copyright notice for the bundle visible to the user. Optional. See
StringFileInfo.

bool application/d3d12_agility_sdk_multiarch

If `true`, and application/export_d3d12 is set, the Agility SDK DLLs will be
stored in arch-specific subdirectories.

int application/export_angle

If set to `1`, ANGLE libraries are exported with the exported application. If
set to `0`, ANGLE libraries are exported only if
ProjectSettings.rendering/gl_compatibility/driver is set to `"opengl3_angle"`.

int application/export_d3d12

If set to `1`, the Direct3D 12 runtime libraries (Agility SDK, PIX) are
exported with the exported application. If set to `0`, Direct3D 12 libraries
are exported only if ProjectSettings.rendering/rendering_device/driver is set
to `"d3d12"`.

String application/file_description

File description to be presented to users. Required. See StringFileInfo.

String application/file_version

Version number of the file. Falls back to
ProjectSettings.application/config/version if left empty. See StringFileInfo.

String application/icon

Application icon file. If left empty, it will fallback to
ProjectSettings.application/config/windows_native_icon, and then to
ProjectSettings.application/config/icon.

int application/icon_interpolation

Interpolation method used to resize application icon.

bool application/modify_resources

If enabled, icon and metadata of the exported executable is set according to
the other `application/*` values.

String application/product_name

Name of the application. Required. See StringFileInfo.

String application/product_version

Application version visible to the user. Falls back to
ProjectSettings.application/config/version if left empty. See StringFileInfo.

String application/trademarks

Trademarks and registered trademarks that apply to the file. Optional. See
StringFileInfo.

String binary_format/architecture

Application executable architecture.

Supported architectures: `x86_32`, `x86_64`, and `arm64`.

bool binary_format/embed_pck

If `true`, project resources are embedded into the executable.

PackedStringArray codesign/custom_options

Array of the additional command line arguments passed to the code signing
tool. See Sign Tool.

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedStringArray for more details.

String codesign/description

Description of the signed content. See Sign Tool.

int codesign/digest_algorithm

Digest algorithm to use for creating signature. See Sign Tool.

bool codesign/enable

If `true`, executable signing is enabled.

String codesign/identity

PKCS #12 certificate file used to sign executable or certificate SHA-1 hash
(if codesign/identity_type is set to "Use certificate store"). See Sign Tool.

Can be overridden with the environment variable
`GODOT_WINDOWS_CODESIGN_IDENTITY`.

int codesign/identity_type

Type of identity to use. See Sign Tool.

Can be overridden with the environment variable
`GODOT_WINDOWS_CODESIGN_IDENTITY_TYPE`.

String codesign/password

Password for the certificate file used to sign executable. See Sign Tool.

Can be overridden with the environment variable
`GODOT_WINDOWS_CODESIGN_PASSWORD`.

bool codesign/timestamp

If `true`, time-stamp is added to the signature. See Sign Tool.

String codesign/timestamp_server_url

URL of the time stamp server. If left empty, the default server is used. See
Sign Tool.

String custom_template/debug

String custom_template/release

Path to the custom export template. If left empty, default template is used.

int debug/export_console_wrapper

If `true`, a console wrapper executable is exported alongside the main
executable, which allows running the project with enabled console output.

String ssh_remote_deploy/cleanup_script

Script code to execute on the remote host when app is finished.

The following variables can be used in the script:

  * `{temp_dir}` \- Path of temporary folder on the remote, used to upload app and scripts to.

  * `{archive_name}` \- Name of the ZIP containing uploaded application.

  * `{exe_name}` \- Name of application executable.

  * `{cmd_args}` \- Array of the command line argument for the application.

bool ssh_remote_deploy/enabled

Enables remote deploy using SSH/SCP.

String ssh_remote_deploy/extra_args_scp

String ssh_remote_deploy/port

Remote host SSH port number.

String ssh_remote_deploy/run_script

Script code to execute on the remote host when running the app.

The following variables can be used in the script:

  * `{temp_dir}` \- Path of temporary folder on the remote, used to upload app and scripts to.

  * `{archive_name}` \- Name of the ZIP containing uploaded application.
