# NativeMenu

Inherits: Object

A server interface for OS native menus.

## Description

NativeMenu handles low-level access to the OS native global menu bar and popup
menus.

Note: This is low-level API, consider using MenuBar with
MenuBar.prefer_global_menu set to `true`, and PopupMenu with
PopupMenu.prefer_native_menu set to `true`.

To create a menu, use create_menu(), add menu items using `add_*_item`
methods. To remove a menu, use free_menu().

    
    
    var menu
    
    func _menu_callback(item_id):
        if item_id == "ITEM_CUT":
            cut()
        elif item_id == "ITEM_COPY":
            copy()
        elif item_id == "ITEM_PASTE":
            paste()
    
    func _enter_tree():
        # Create new menu and add items:
        menu = NativeMenu.create_menu()
        NativeMenu.add_item(menu, "Cut", _menu_callback, Callable(), "ITEM_CUT")
        NativeMenu.add_item(menu, "Copy", _menu_callback, Callable(), "ITEM_COPY")
        NativeMenu.add_separator(menu)
        NativeMenu.add_item(menu, "Paste", _menu_callback, Callable(), "ITEM_PASTE")
    
    func _on_button_pressed():
        # Show popup menu at mouse position:
        NativeMenu.popup(menu, DisplayServer.mouse_get_position())
    
    func _exit_tree():
        # Remove menu when it's no longer needed:
        NativeMenu.free_menu(menu)

## Method Descriptions

int add_check_item(rid: RID, label: String, callback: Callable = Callable(),
key_callback: Callable = Callable(), tag: Variant = null, accelerator: Key =
0, index: int = -1)

Adds a new checkable item with text `label` to the global menu `rid`.

Returns index of the inserted item, it's not guaranteed to be the same as
`index` value.

An `accelerator` can optionally be defined, which is a keyboard shortcut that can be pressed to trigger the menu button even if it's not currently open. The `accelerator` is generally a combination of KeyModifierMasks and Keys using bitwise OR such as `KEY_MASK_CTRL | KEY_A` (``Ctrl` + `A``).

Note: The `callback` and `key_callback` Callables need to accept exactly one
Variant parameter, the parameter passed to the Callables will be the value
passed to `tag`.

Note: This method is implemented on macOS and Windows.

Note: On Windows, `accelerator` and `key_callback` are ignored.

int add_icon_check_item(rid: RID, icon: Texture2D, label: String, callback:
Callable = Callable(), key_callback: Callable = Callable(), tag: Variant =
null, accelerator: Key = 0, index: int = -1)

Adds a new checkable item with text `label` and icon `icon` to the global menu
`rid`.

Returns index of the inserted item, it's not guaranteed to be the same as
`index` value.

An `accelerator` can optionally be defined, which is a keyboard shortcut that can be pressed to trigger the menu button even if it's not currently open. The `accelerator` is generally a combination of KeyModifierMasks and Keys using bitwise OR such as `KEY_MASK_CTRL | KEY_A` (``Ctrl` + `A``).

Note: The `callback` and `key_callback` Callables need to accept exactly one
Variant parameter, the parameter passed to the Callables will be the value
passed to `tag`.

Note: This method is implemented on macOS and Windows.

Note: On Windows, `accelerator` and `key_callback` are ignored.

int add_icon_item(rid: RID, icon: Texture2D, label: String, callback: Callable
= Callable(), key_callback: Callable = Callable(), tag: Variant = null,
accelerator: Key = 0, index: int = -1)

Adds a new item with text `label` and icon `icon` to the global menu `rid`.

Returns index of the inserted item, it's not guaranteed to be the same as
`index` value.

An `accelerator` can optionally be defined, which is a keyboard shortcut that can be pressed to trigger the menu button even if it's not currently open. The `accelerator` is generally a combination of KeyModifierMasks and Keys using bitwise OR such as `KEY_MASK_CTRL | KEY_A` (``Ctrl` + `A``).

Note: The `callback` and `key_callback` Callables need to accept exactly one
Variant parameter, the parameter passed to the Callables will be the value
passed to `tag`.

int add_icon_radio_check_item(rid: RID, icon: Texture2D, label: String,
callback: Callable = Callable(), key_callback: Callable = Callable(), tag:
Variant = null, accelerator: Key = 0, index: int = -1)

Adds a new radio-checkable item with text `label` and icon `icon` to the
global menu `rid`.

Returns index of the inserted item, it's not guaranteed to be the same as
`index` value.

An `accelerator` can optionally be defined, which is a keyboard shortcut that can be pressed to trigger the menu button even if it's not currently open. The `accelerator` is generally a combination of KeyModifierMasks and Keys using bitwise OR such as `KEY_MASK_CTRL | KEY_A` (``Ctrl` + `A``).

Note: Radio-checkable items just display a checkmark, but don't have any
built-in checking behavior and must be checked/unchecked manually. See
set_item_checked() for more info on how to control it.

Note: The `callback` and `key_callback` Callables need to accept exactly one
Variant parameter, the parameter passed to the Callables will be the value
passed to `tag`.

Note: This method is implemented on macOS and Windows.

Note: On Windows, `accelerator` and `key_callback` are ignored.

Adds a new item with text `label` to the global menu `rid`.

Contrarily to normal binary items, multistate items can have more than two
states, as defined by `max_states`. Each press or activate of the item will
increase the state by one. The default value is defined by `default_state`.

Returns index of the inserted item, it's not guaranteed to be the same as
`index` value.

An `accelerator` can optionally be defined, which is a keyboard shortcut that can be pressed to trigger the menu button even if it's not currently open. The `accelerator` is generally a combination of KeyModifierMasks and Keys using bitwise OR such as `KEY_MASK_CTRL | KEY_A` (``Ctrl` + `A``).

Note: By default, there's no indication of the current item state, it should
be changed manually.

Note: The `callback` and `key_callback` Callables need to accept exactly one
Variant parameter, the parameter passed to the Callables will be the value
passed to `tag`.

Note: This method is implemented on macOS and Windows.

Note: On Windows, `accelerator` and `key_callback` are ignored.
