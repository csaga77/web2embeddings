# CylinderMesh

Inherits: PrimitiveMesh < Mesh < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Class representing a cylindrical PrimitiveMesh.

## Description

Class representing a cylindrical PrimitiveMesh. This class can be used to
create cones by setting either the top_radius or bottom_radius properties to
`0.0`.

## Properties

float | bottom_radius | `0.5`  
---|---|---  
bool | cap_bottom | `true`  
bool | cap_top | `true`  
float | height | `2.0`  
int | radial_segments | `64`  
int | rings | `4`  
float | top_radius | `0.5`  
  
## Property Descriptions

float bottom_radius = `0.5`

  * void set_bottom_radius(value: float)

  * float get_bottom_radius()

Bottom radius of the cylinder. If set to `0.0`, the bottom faces will not be
generated, resulting in a conic shape. See also cap_bottom.

bool cap_bottom = `true`

  * void set_cap_bottom(value: bool)

  * bool is_cap_bottom()

If `true`, generates a cap at the bottom of the cylinder. This can be set to
`false` to speed up generation and rendering when the cap is never seen by the
camera. See also bottom_radius.

Note: If bottom_radius is `0.0`, cap generation is always skipped even if
cap_bottom is `true`.

bool cap_top = `true`

  * void set_cap_top(value: bool)

  * bool is_cap_top()

If `true`, generates a cap at the top of the cylinder. This can be set to
`false` to speed up generation and rendering when the cap is never seen by the
camera. See also top_radius.

Note: If top_radius is `0.0`, cap generation is always skipped even if cap_top
is `true`.

float height = `2.0`

  * void set_height(value: float)

  * float get_height()

Full height of the cylinder.

int radial_segments = `64`

  * void set_radial_segments(value: int)

  * int get_radial_segments()

Number of radial segments on the cylinder. Higher values result in a more
detailed cylinder/cone at the cost of performance.

int rings = `4`

  * void set_rings(value: int)

  * int get_rings()

Number of edge rings along the height of the cylinder. Changing rings does not
have any visual impact unless a shader or procedural mesh tool is used to
alter the vertex data. Higher values result in more subdivisions, which can be
used to create smoother-looking effects with shaders or procedural mesh tools
(at the cost of performance). When not altering the vertex data using a shader
or procedural mesh tool, rings should be kept to its default value.

float top_radius = `0.5`

  * void set_top_radius(value: float)

  * float get_top_radius()

Top radius of the cylinder. If set to `0.0`, the top faces will not be
generated, resulting in a conic shape. See also cap_top.
