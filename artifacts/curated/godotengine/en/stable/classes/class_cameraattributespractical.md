# CameraAttributesPractical

Inherits: CameraAttributes < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Camera settings in an easy to use format.

## Description

Controls camera-specific attributes such as auto-exposure, depth of field, and
exposure override.

When used in a WorldEnvironment it provides default settings for exposure,
auto-exposure, and depth of field that will be used by all cameras without
their own CameraAttributes, including the editor camera. When used in a
Camera3D it will override any CameraAttributes set in the WorldEnvironment.
When used in VoxelGI or LightmapGI, only the exposure settings will be used.

## Property Descriptions

float auto_exposure_max_sensitivity = `800.0`

  * void set_auto_exposure_max_sensitivity(value: float)

  * float get_auto_exposure_max_sensitivity()

The maximum sensitivity (in ISO) used when calculating auto exposure. When
calculating scene average luminance, color values will be clamped to at least
this value. This limits the auto-exposure from exposing below a certain
brightness, resulting in a cut off point where the scene will remain bright.

float auto_exposure_min_sensitivity = `0.0`

  * void set_auto_exposure_min_sensitivity(value: float)

  * float get_auto_exposure_min_sensitivity()

The minimum sensitivity (in ISO) used when calculating auto exposure. When
calculating scene average luminance, color values will be clamped to at least
this value. This limits the auto-exposure from exposing above a certain
brightness, resulting in a cut off point where the scene will remain dark.

float dof_blur_amount = `0.1`

  * void set_dof_blur_amount(value: float)

  * float get_dof_blur_amount()

Sets the maximum amount of blur. When using physically-based blur amounts,
will instead act as a multiplier. High values lead to an increased amount of
blurriness, but can be much more expensive to calculate. It is best to keep
this as low as possible for a given art style.

float dof_blur_far_distance = `10.0`

  * void set_dof_blur_far_distance(value: float)

  * float get_dof_blur_far_distance()

Objects further from the Camera3D by this amount will be blurred by the depth
of field effect. Measured in meters.

bool dof_blur_far_enabled = `false`

  * void set_dof_blur_far_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_dof_blur_far_enabled()

Enables depth of field blur for objects further than dof_blur_far_distance.
Strength of blur is controlled by dof_blur_amount and modulated by
dof_blur_far_transition.

Note: Depth of field blur is only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile
rendering methods, not Compatibility.

float dof_blur_far_transition = `5.0`

  * void set_dof_blur_far_transition(value: float)

  * float get_dof_blur_far_transition()

When positive, distance over which (starting from dof_blur_far_distance) blur
effect will scale from 0 to dof_blur_amount. When negative, uses physically-
based scaling so depth of field effect will scale from 0 at
dof_blur_far_distance and will increase in a physically accurate way as
objects get further from the Camera3D.

float dof_blur_near_distance = `2.0`

  * void set_dof_blur_near_distance(value: float)

  * float get_dof_blur_near_distance()

Objects closer from the Camera3D by this amount will be blurred by the depth
of field effect. Measured in meters.

bool dof_blur_near_enabled = `false`

  * void set_dof_blur_near_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_dof_blur_near_enabled()

Enables depth of field blur for objects closer than dof_blur_near_distance.
Strength of blur is controlled by dof_blur_amount and modulated by
dof_blur_near_transition.

Note: Depth of field blur is only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile
rendering methods, not Compatibility.

float dof_blur_near_transition = `1.0`

  * void set_dof_blur_near_transition(value: float)

  * float get_dof_blur_near_transition()

When positive, distance over which blur effect will scale from 0 to
dof_blur_amount, ending at dof_blur_near_distance. When negative, uses
physically-based scaling so depth of field effect will scale from 0 at
dof_blur_near_distance and will increase in a physically accurate way as
objects get closer to the Camera3D.
