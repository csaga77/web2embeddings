# CompositorEffect

Experimental: The implementation may change as more of the rendering internals
are exposed over time.

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

This resource allows for creating a custom rendering effect.

## Description

This resource defines a custom rendering effect that can be applied to
Viewports through the viewports' Environment. You can implement a callback
that is called during rendering at a given stage of the rendering pipeline and
allows you to insert additional passes. Note that this callback happens on the
rendering thread. CompositorEffect is an abstract base class and must be
extended to implement specific rendering logic.

## Enumerations

enum EffectCallbackType:

EffectCallbackType EFFECT_CALLBACK_TYPE_PRE_OPAQUE = `0`

The callback is called before our opaque rendering pass, but after depth
prepass (if applicable).

EffectCallbackType EFFECT_CALLBACK_TYPE_POST_OPAQUE = `1`

The callback is called after our opaque rendering pass, but before our sky is
rendered.

EffectCallbackType EFFECT_CALLBACK_TYPE_POST_SKY = `2`

The callback is called after our sky is rendered, but before our back buffers
are created (and if enabled, before subsurface scattering and/or screen space
reflections).

EffectCallbackType EFFECT_CALLBACK_TYPE_PRE_TRANSPARENT = `3`

The callback is called before our transparent rendering pass, but after our
sky is rendered and we've created our back buffers.

EffectCallbackType EFFECT_CALLBACK_TYPE_POST_TRANSPARENT = `4`

The callback is called after our transparent rendering pass, but before any
built-in post-processing effects and output to our render target.

EffectCallbackType EFFECT_CALLBACK_TYPE_MAX = `5`

Represents the size of the EffectCallbackType enum.

## Property Descriptions

bool access_resolved_color

  * void set_access_resolved_color(value: bool)

  * bool get_access_resolved_color()

If `true` and MSAA is enabled, this will trigger a color buffer resolve before
the effect is run.

Note: In _render_callback(), to access the resolved buffer use:

    
    
    var render_scene_buffers = render_data.get_render_scene_buffers()
    var color_buffer = render_scene_buffers.get_texture("render_buffers", "color")
    

bool access_resolved_depth

  * void set_access_resolved_depth(value: bool)

  * bool get_access_resolved_depth()

If `true` and MSAA is enabled, this will trigger a depth buffer resolve before
the effect is run.

Note: In _render_callback(), to access the resolved buffer use:

    
    
    var render_scene_buffers = render_data.get_render_scene_buffers()
    var depth_buffer = render_scene_buffers.get_texture("render_buffers", "depth")
    

EffectCallbackType effect_callback_type

  * void set_effect_callback_type(value: EffectCallbackType)

  * EffectCallbackType get_effect_callback_type()

The type of effect that is implemented, determines at what stage of rendering
the callback is called.

bool enabled

  * void set_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool get_enabled()

If `true` this rendering effect is applied to any viewport it is added to.

bool needs_motion_vectors

  * void set_needs_motion_vectors(value: bool)

  * bool get_needs_motion_vectors()

If `true` this triggers motion vectors being calculated during the opaque
render state.

Note: In _render_callback(), to access the motion vector buffer use:

    
    
    var render_scene_buffers = render_data.get_render_scene_buffers()
    var motion_buffer = render_scene_buffers.get_velocity_texture()
    

bool needs_normal_roughness

  * void set_needs_normal_roughness(value: bool)

  * bool get_needs_normal_roughness()

If `true` this triggers normal and roughness data to be output during our
depth pre-pass, only applicable for the Forward+ renderer.

Note: In _render_callback(), to access the roughness buffer use:

    
    
    var render_scene_buffers = render_data.get_render_scene_buffers()
    var roughness_buffer = render_scene_buffers.get_texture("forward_clustered", "normal_roughness")
    

The raw normal and roughness buffer is stored in an optimized format,
different than the one available in Spatial shaders. When sampling the buffer,
a conversion function must be applied. Use this function, copied from here:

    
    
    vec4 normal_roughness_compatibility(vec4 p_normal_roughness) {
        float roughness = p_normal_roughness.w;
        if (roughness > 0.5) {
            roughness = 1.0 - roughness;
        }
        roughness /= (127.0 / 255.0);
        return vec4(normalize(p_normal_roughness.xyz * 2.0 - 1.0) * 0.5 + 0.5, roughness);
    }
    

bool needs_separate_specular

  * void set_needs_separate_specular(value: bool)

  * bool get_needs_separate_specular()

If `true` this triggers specular data being rendered to a separate buffer and
combined after effects have been applied, only applicable for the Forward+
renderer.

## Method Descriptions

void _render_callback(effect_callback_type: int, render_data: RenderData)
virtual

Implement this function with your custom rendering code.
`effect_callback_type` should always match the effect callback type you've
specified in effect_callback_type. `render_data` provides access to the
rendering state, it is only valid during rendering and should not be stored.
