# EditorInspectorPlugin

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Plugin for adding custom property editors on the inspector.

## Description

EditorInspectorPlugin allows adding custom property editors to
EditorInspector.

When an object is edited, the _can_handle() function is called and must return
`true` if the object type is supported.

If supported, the function _parse_begin() will be called, allowing to place
custom controls at the beginning of the class.

Subsequently, the _parse_category() and _parse_property() are called for every
category and property. They offer the ability to add custom controls to the
inspector too.

Finally, _parse_end() will be called.

On each of these calls, the "add" functions can be called.

To use EditorInspectorPlugin, register it using the
EditorPlugin.add_inspector_plugin() method first.

## Method Descriptions

bool _can_handle(object: Object) virtual const

Returns `true` if this object can be handled by this plugin.

void _parse_begin(object: Object) virtual

Called to allow adding controls at the beginning of the property list for
`object`.

void _parse_category(object: Object, category: String) virtual

Called to allow adding controls at the beginning of a category in the property
list for `object`.

void _parse_end(object: Object) virtual

Called to allow adding controls at the end of the property list for `object`.

void _parse_group(object: Object, group: String) virtual

Called to allow adding controls at the beginning of a group or a sub-group in
the property list for `object`.

bool _parse_property(object: Object, type: Variant.Type, name: String,
hint_type: PropertyHint, hint_string: String, usage_flags:
BitField[PropertyUsageFlags], wide: bool) virtual

Called to allow adding property-specific editors to the property list for
`object`. The added editor control must extend EditorProperty. Returning
`true` removes the built-in editor for this property, otherwise allows to
insert a custom editor before the built-in one.

void add_custom_control(control: Control)

Adds a custom control, which is not necessarily a property editor.

void add_property_editor(property: String, editor: Control, add_to_end: bool =
false, label: String = "")

Adds a property editor for an individual property. The `editor` control must
extend EditorProperty.

There can be multiple property editors for a property. If `add_to_end` is
`true`, this newly added editor will be displayed after all the other editors
of the property whose `add_to_end` is `false`. For example, the editor uses
this parameter to add an "Edit Region" button for Sprite2D.region_rect below
the regular Rect2 editor.

`label` can be used to choose a custom label for the property editor in the
inspector. If left empty, the label is computed from the name of the property
instead.

void add_property_editor_for_multiple_properties(label: String, properties:
PackedStringArray, editor: Control)

Adds an editor that allows modifying multiple properties. The `editor` control
must extend EditorProperty.
