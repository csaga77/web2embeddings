# PhysicsServer3DManager

Inherits: Object

A singleton for managing PhysicsServer3D implementations.

## Description

PhysicsServer3DManager is the API for registering PhysicsServer3D
implementations and for setting the default implementation.

Note: It is not possible to switch physics servers at runtime. This class is
only used on startup at the server initialization level, by Godot itself and
possibly by GDExtensions.

## Methods

void | register_server(name: String, create_callback: Callable)  
---|---  
void | set_default_server(name: String, priority: int)  
  
## Method Descriptions

void register_server(name: String, create_callback: Callable)

Register a PhysicsServer3D implementation by passing a `name` and a Callable
that returns a PhysicsServer3D object.

void set_default_server(name: String, priority: int)

Set the default PhysicsServer3D implementation to the one identified by
`name`, if `priority` is greater than the priority of the current default
implementation.
