# ResourceImporterImageFont

Inherits: ResourceImporter < RefCounted < Object

Imports a bitmap font where all glyphs have the same width and height.

## Description

This image-based workflow can be easier to use than ResourceImporterBMFont,
but it requires all glyphs to have the same width and height, glyph advances
and drawing offsets can be customized. This makes ResourceImporterImageFont
most suited to fixed-width fonts.

See also ResourceImporterDynamicFont.

## Property Descriptions

int ascent = `0`

Font ascent (number of pixels above the baseline). If set to `0`, half of the
character height is used.

Rect2i character_margin = `Rect2i(0, 0, 0, 0)`

Margin applied around every imported glyph. If your font image contains guides
(in the form of lines between glyphs) or if spacing between characters appears
incorrect, try adjusting character_margin.

PackedStringArray character_ranges = `PackedStringArray()`

The character ranges to import from the font image. This is an array that maps
each position on the image (in tile coordinates, not pixels). The font atlas
is traversed from left to right and top to bottom. Characters can be specified
with decimal numbers (127), hexadecimal numbers (`0x007f`, or `U+007f`) or
between single quotes (`'~'`). Ranges can be specified with a hyphen between
characters.

For example, `0-127` represents the full ASCII range. It can also be written
as `0x0000-0x007f` (or `U+0000-U+007f`). As another example, `' '-'~'` is
equivalent to `32-127` and represents the range of printable (visible) ASCII
characters.

For any range, the character advance and offset can be customized by appending
three space-separated integer values (additional advance, x offset, y offset)
to the end. For example `'a'-'b' 4 5 2` sets the advance to `char_width + 4`
and offset to `Vector2(5, 2)` for both a and b characters.

Make sure character_ranges doesn't exceed the number of columns * rows
defined. Otherwise, the font will fail to import.

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedStringArray for more details.

int columns = `1`

Number of columns in the font image. See also rows.

bool compress = `true`

If `true`, uses lossless compression for the resulting font.

int descent = `0`

Font descent (number of pixels below the baseline). If set to `0`, half of the
character height is used.

Array fallbacks = `[]`

List of font fallbacks to use if a glyph isn't found in this bitmap font.
Fonts at the beginning of the array are attempted first.

Rect2i image_margin = `Rect2i(0, 0, 0, 0)`

Margin to cut on the sides of the entire image. This can be used to cut parts
of the image that contain attribution information or similar.

PackedStringArray kerning_pairs = `PackedStringArray()`

Kerning pairs for the font. Kerning pair adjust the spacing between two
characters.

Each string consist of three space separated values: "from" string, "to"
string and integer offset. Each combination form the two string for a kerning
pair, e.g, `ab cd -3` will create kerning pairs `ac`, `ad`, `bc`, and `bd`
with offset `-3`. `\uXXXX` escape sequences can be used to add Unicode
characters.

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedStringArray for more details.

int rows = `1`

Number of rows in the font image. See also columns.

int scaling_mode = `2`

Font scaling mode.
