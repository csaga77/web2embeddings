# Light3D

Inherits: VisualInstance3D < Node3D < Node < Object

Inherited By: DirectionalLight3D, OmniLight3D, SpotLight3D

Provides a base class for different kinds of light nodes.

## Description

Light3D is the abstract base class for light nodes. As it can't be
instantiated, it shouldn't be used directly. Other types of light nodes
inherit from it. Light3D contains the common variables and parameters used for
lighting.

enum BakeMode:

BakeMode BAKE_DISABLED = `0`

Light is ignored when baking. This is the fastest mode, but the light will be
taken into account when baking global illumination. This mode should generally
be used for dynamic lights that change quickly, as the effect of global
illumination is less noticeable on those lights.

Note: Hiding a light does not affect baking LightmapGI. Hiding a light will
still affect baking VoxelGI and SDFGI (see Environment.sdfgi_enabled).

BakeMode BAKE_STATIC = `1`

Light is taken into account in static baking (VoxelGI, LightmapGI, SDFGI
(Environment.sdfgi_enabled)). The light can be moved around or modified, but
its global illumination will not update in real-time. This is suitable for
subtle changes (such as flickering torches), but generally not large changes
such as toggling a light on and off.

Note: The light is not baked in LightmapGI if editor_only is `true`.

BakeMode BAKE_DYNAMIC = `2`

Light is taken into account in dynamic baking (VoxelGI and SDFGI
(Environment.sdfgi_enabled) only). The light can be moved around or modified
with global illumination updating in real-time. The light's global
illumination appearance will be slightly different compared to BAKE_STATIC.
This has a greater performance cost compared to BAKE_STATIC. When using SDFGI,
the update speed of dynamic lights is affected by
ProjectSettings.rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/frames_to_update_lights.

## Property Descriptions

float distance_fade_begin = `40.0`

  * void set_distance_fade_begin(value: float)

  * float get_distance_fade_begin()

The distance from the camera at which the light begins to fade away (in 3D
units).

Note: Only effective for OmniLight3D and SpotLight3D.

bool distance_fade_enabled = `false`

  * void set_enable_distance_fade(value: bool)

  * bool is_distance_fade_enabled()

If `true`, the light will smoothly fade away when far from the active Camera3D
starting at distance_fade_begin. This acts as a form of level of detail (LOD).
The light will fade out over distance_fade_begin \+ distance_fade_length,
after which it will be culled and not sent to the shader at all. Use this to
reduce the number of active lights in a scene and thus improve performance.

Note: Only effective for OmniLight3D and SpotLight3D.

float distance_fade_length = `10.0`

  * void set_distance_fade_length(value: float)

  * float get_distance_fade_length()

Distance over which the light and its shadow fades. The light's energy and
shadow's opacity is progressively reduced over this distance and is completely
invisible at the end.

Note: Only effective for OmniLight3D and SpotLight3D.

float distance_fade_shadow = `50.0`

  * void set_distance_fade_shadow(value: float)

  * float get_distance_fade_shadow()

The distance from the camera at which the light's shadow cuts off (in 3D
units). Set this to a value lower than distance_fade_begin \+
distance_fade_length to further improve performance, as shadow rendering is
often more expensive than light rendering itself.

Note: Only effective for OmniLight3D and SpotLight3D, and only when
shadow_enabled is `true`.

bool editor_only = `false`

  * void set_editor_only(value: bool)

  * bool is_editor_only()

If `true`, the light only appears in the editor and will not be visible at
runtime. If `true`, the light will never be baked in LightmapGI regardless of
its light_bake_mode.

float light_angular_distance = `0.0`

  * void set_param(param: Param, value: float)

  * float get_param(param: Param) const

The light's angular size in degrees. Increasing this will make shadows softer
at greater distances (also called percentage-closer soft shadows, or PCSS).
Only available for DirectionalLight3Ds. For reference, the Sun from the Earth
is approximately `0.5`. Increasing this value above `0.0` for lights with
shadows enabled will have a noticeable performance cost due to PCSS.

Note: light_angular_distance is not affected by Node3D.scale (the light's
scale or its parent's scale).

Note: PCSS for directional lights is only supported in the Forward+ rendering
method, not Mobile or Compatibility.

BakeMode light_bake_mode = `2`

  * void set_bake_mode(value: BakeMode)

  * BakeMode get_bake_mode()

The light's bake mode. This will affect the global illumination techniques
that have an effect on the light's rendering. See BakeMode.

Note: Meshes' global illumination mode will also affect the global
illumination rendering. See GeometryInstance3D.gi_mode.

Color light_color = `Color(1, 1, 1, 1)`

  * void set_color(value: Color)

  * Color get_color()

The light's color. An overbright color can be used to achieve a result
equivalent to increasing the light's light_energy.

int light_cull_mask = `4294967295`

  * void set_cull_mask(value: int)

  * int get_cull_mask()

The light will affect objects in the selected layers.

float light_energy = `1.0`

  * void set_param(param: Param, value: float)

  * float get_param(param: Param) const

The light's strength multiplier (this is not a physical unit). For OmniLight3D
and SpotLight3D, changing this value will only change the light color's
intensity, not the light's radius.

float light_indirect_energy = `1.0`

  * void set_param(param: Param, value: float)

  * float get_param(param: Param) const

Secondary multiplier used with indirect light (light bounces). Used with
VoxelGI and SDFGI (see Environment.sdfgi_enabled).

Note: This property is ignored if light_energy is equal to `0.0`, as the light
won't be present at all in the GI shader.

float light_intensity_lumens

  * void set_param(param: Param, value: float)

  * float get_param(param: Param) const

Used by positional lights (OmniLight3D and SpotLight3D) when
ProjectSettings.rendering/lights_and_shadows/use_physical_light_units is
`true`. Sets the intensity of the light source measured in Lumens. Lumens are
a measure of luminous flux, which is the total amount of visible light emitted
by a light source per unit of time.

For SpotLight3Ds, we assume that the area outside the visible cone is
surrounded by a perfect light absorbing material. Accordingly, the apparent
brightness of the cone area does not change as the cone increases and
decreases in size.

A typical household lightbulb can range from around 600 lumens to 1,200
lumens, a candle is about 13 lumens, while a streetlight can be approximately
60,000 lumens.

float light_intensity_lux

  * void set_param(param: Param, value: float)

  * float get_param(param: Param) const

Used by DirectionalLight3Ds when
ProjectSettings.rendering/lights_and_shadows/use_physical_light_units is
`true`. Sets the intensity of the light source measured in Lux. Lux is a
measure of luminous flux per unit area, it is equal to one lumen per square
meter. Lux is the measure of how much light hits a surface at a given time.

On a clear sunny day a surface in direct sunlight may be approximately 100,000
lux, a typical room in a home may be approximately 50 lux, while the moonlit
ground may be approximately 0.1 lux.

bool light_negative = `false`

  * void set_negative(value: bool)

  * bool is_negative()

If `true`, the light's effect is reversed, darkening areas and casting bright
shadows.

Texture2D light_projector

  * void set_projector(value: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_projector()

Texture2D projected by light. shadow_enabled must be on for the projector to
work. Light projectors make the light appear as if it is shining through a
colored but transparent object, almost like light shining through stained-
glass.

Note: Unlike BaseMaterial3D whose filter mode can be adjusted on a per-
material basis, the filter mode for light projector textures is set globally
with ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/light_projectors/filter.

Note: Light projector textures are only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile
rendering methods, not Compatibility.

float light_size = `0.0`

  * void set_param(param: Param, value: float)

  * float get_param(param: Param) const

The size of the light in Godot units. Only available for OmniLight3Ds and
SpotLight3Ds. Increasing this value will make the light fade out slower and
shadows appear blurrier (also called percentage-closer soft shadows, or PCSS).
This can be used to simulate area lights to an extent. Increasing this value
above `0.0` for lights with shadows enabled will have a noticeable performance
cost due to PCSS.

Note: light_size is not affected by Node3D.scale (the light's scale or its
parent's scale).

Note: PCSS for positional lights is only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile
rendering methods, not Compatibility.

float light_specular = `1.0`

  * void set_param(param: Param, value: float)

  * float get_param(param: Param) const

The intensity of the specular blob in objects affected by the light. At `0`,
the light becomes a pure diffuse light. When not baking emission, this can be
used to avoid unrealistic reflections when placing lights above an emissive
surface.

float light_temperature

  * void set_temperature(value: float)

  * float get_temperature()

Sets the color temperature of the light source, measured in Kelvin. This is
used to calculate a correlated color temperature which tints the light_color.

The sun on a cloudy day is approximately 6500 Kelvin, on a clear day it is
between 5500 to 6000 Kelvin, and on a clear day at sunrise or sunset it ranges
to around 1850 Kelvin.

float light_volumetric_fog_energy = `1.0`

  * void set_param(param: Param, value: float)

  * float get_param(param: Param) const

Secondary multiplier multiplied with light_energy then used with the
Environment's volumetric fog (if enabled). If set to `0.0`, computing
volumetric fog will be skipped for this light, which can improve performance
for large amounts of lights when volumetric fog is enabled.

Note: To prevent short-lived dynamic light effects from poorly interacting
with volumetric fog, lights used in those effects should have
light_volumetric_fog_energy set to `0.0` unless
Environment.volumetric_fog_temporal_reprojection_enabled is disabled (or
unless the reprojection amount is significantly lowered).

float shadow_bias = `0.1`

  * void set_param(param: Param, value: float)

  * float get_param(param: Param) const

Used to adjust shadow appearance. Too small a value results in self-shadowing
("shadow acne"), while too large a value causes shadows to separate from
casters ("peter-panning"). Adjust as needed.

float shadow_blur = `1.0`

  * void set_param(param: Param, value: float)

  * float get_param(param: Param) const

Blurs the edges of the shadow. Can be used to hide pixel artifacts in low-
resolution shadow maps. A high value can impact performance, make shadows
appear grainy and can cause other unwanted artifacts. Try to keep as near
default as possible.

int shadow_caster_mask = `4294967295`

  * void set_shadow_caster_mask(value: int)

  * int get_shadow_caster_mask()

The light will only cast shadows using objects in the selected layers.

bool shadow_enabled = `false`

  * void set_shadow(value: bool)

  * bool has_shadow()

If `true`, the light will cast real-time shadows. This has a significant
performance cost. Only enable shadow rendering when it makes a noticeable
difference in the scene's appearance, and consider using distance_fade_enabled
to hide the light when far away from the Camera3D.

float shadow_normal_bias = `2.0`

  * void set_param(param: Param, value: float)

  * float get_param(param: Param) const

Offsets the lookup into the shadow map by the object's normal. This can be
used to reduce self-shadowing artifacts without using shadow_bias. In
practice, this value should be tweaked along with shadow_bias to reduce
artifacts as much as possible.

float shadow_opacity = `1.0`

  * void set_param(param: Param, value: float)

  * float get_param(param: Param) const

The opacity to use when rendering the light's shadow map. Values lower than
`1.0` make the light appear through shadows. This can be used to fake global
illumination at a low performance cost.

bool shadow_reverse_cull_face = `false`

  * void set_shadow_reverse_cull_face(value: bool)

  * bool get_shadow_reverse_cull_face()

If `true`, reverses the backface culling of the mesh. This can be useful when
you have a flat mesh that has a light behind it. If you need to cast a shadow
on both sides of the mesh, set the mesh to use double-sided shadows with
GeometryInstance3D.SHADOW_CASTING_SETTING_DOUBLE_SIDED.

float shadow_transmittance_bias = `0.05`

  * void set_param(param: Param, value: float)

  * float get_param(param: Param) const

There is currently no description for this property. Please help us by
contributing one!
