# AnimationPlayer

Inherits: AnimationMixer < Node < Object

A node used for animation playback.

## Description

An animation player is used for general-purpose playback of animations. It
contains a dictionary of AnimationLibrary resources and custom blend times
between animation transitions.

Some methods and properties use a single key to reference an animation
directly. These keys are formatted as the key for the library, followed by a
forward slash, then the key for the animation within the library, for example
`"movement/run"`. If the library's key is an empty string (known as the
default library), the forward slash is omitted, being the same key used by the
library.

AnimationPlayer is better-suited than Tween for more complex animations, for
example ones with non-trivial timings. It can also be used over Tween if the
animation track editor is more convenient than doing it in code.

Updating the target properties of animations occurs at the process frame.

See also queue().

Note: The signal is not emitted when the animation is changed via play() or by
an AnimationTree.

current_animation_changed(name: String)

Emitted when current_animation changes.

## Property Descriptions

String assigned_animation

  * void set_assigned_animation(value: String)

  * String get_assigned_animation()

If playing, the current animation's key, otherwise, the animation last played.
When set, this changes the animation, but will not play it unless already
playing. See also current_animation.

String autoplay = `""`

  * void set_autoplay(value: String)

  * String get_autoplay()

The key of the animation to play when the scene loads.

String current_animation = `""`

  * void set_current_animation(value: String)

  * String get_current_animation()

The key of the currently playing animation. If no animation is playing, the
property's value is an empty string. Changing this value does not restart the
animation. See play() for more information on playing animations.

Note: While this property appears in the Inspector, it's not meant to be
edited, and it's not saved in the scene. This property is mainly used to get
the currently playing animation, and internally for animation playback tracks.
For more information, see Animation.

float current_animation_length

  * float get_current_animation_length()

The length (in seconds) of the currently playing animation.

float current_animation_position

  * float get_current_animation_position()

The position (in seconds) of the currently playing animation.

bool movie_quit_on_finish = `false`

  * void set_movie_quit_on_finish_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_movie_quit_on_finish_enabled()

If `true` and the engine is running in Movie Maker mode (see MovieWriter),
exits the engine with SceneTree.quit() as soon as an animation is done playing
in this AnimationPlayer. A message is printed when the engine quits for this
reason.

Note: This obeys the same logic as the AnimationMixer.animation_finished
signal, so it will not quit the engine if the animation is set to be looping.

bool playback_auto_capture = `true`

  * void set_auto_capture(value: bool)

  * bool is_auto_capture()

If `true`, performs AnimationMixer.capture() before playback automatically.
This means just play_with_capture() is executed with default arguments instead
of play().

Note: Capture interpolation is only performed if the animation contains a
capture track. See also Animation.UPDATE_CAPTURE.

float playback_auto_capture_duration = `-1.0`

  * void set_auto_capture_duration(value: float)

  * float get_auto_capture_duration()

See also play_with_capture() and AnimationMixer.capture().

If playback_auto_capture_duration is negative value, the duration is set to
the interval between the current position and the first key.

EaseType playback_auto_capture_ease_type = `0`

  * void set_auto_capture_ease_type(value: EaseType)

  * EaseType get_auto_capture_ease_type()

The ease type of the capture interpolation. See also EaseType.

TransitionType playback_auto_capture_transition_type = `0`

  * void set_auto_capture_transition_type(value: TransitionType)

  * TransitionType get_auto_capture_transition_type()

The transition type of the capture interpolation. See also TransitionType.

float playback_default_blend_time = `0.0`

  * void set_default_blend_time(value: float)

  * float get_default_blend_time()

The default time in which to blend animations. Ranges from 0 to 4096 with 0.01
precision.

float speed_scale = `1.0`

  * void set_speed_scale(value: float)

  * float get_speed_scale()

The speed scaling ratio. For example, if this value is `1`, then the animation
plays at normal speed. If it's `0.5`, then it plays at half speed. If it's
`2`, then it plays at double speed.

If set to a negative value, the animation is played in reverse. If set to `0`,
the animation will not advance.

## Method Descriptions

StringName animation_get_next(animation_from: StringName) const

Returns the key of the animation which is queued to play after the
`animation_from` animation.

void animation_set_next(animation_from: StringName, animation_to: StringName)

Triggers the `animation_to` animation when the `animation_from` animation
completes.

void clear_queue()

Clears all queued, unplayed animations.

float get_blend_time(animation_from: StringName, animation_to: StringName)
const

Returns the blend time (in seconds) between two animations, referenced by
their keys.

AnimationMethodCallMode get_method_call_mode() const

Deprecated: Use AnimationMixer.callback_mode_method instead.

Returns the call mode used for "Call Method" tracks.

float get_playing_speed() const

Returns the actual playing speed of current animation or `0` if not playing.
This speed is the speed_scale property multiplied by `custom_speed` argument
specified when calling the play() method.

Returns a negative value if the current animation is playing backwards.

AnimationProcessCallback get_process_callback() const

Deprecated: Use AnimationMixer.callback_mode_process instead.

Returns the process notification in which to update animations.

PackedStringArray get_queue()

Returns a list of the animation keys that are currently queued to play.

NodePath get_root() const

Deprecated: Use AnimationMixer.root_node instead.

Returns the node which node path references will travel from.

float get_section_end_time() const

Returns the end time of the section currently being played.

float get_section_start_time() const

Returns the start time of the section currently being played.

bool has_section() const

Returns `true` if an animation is currently playing with section.

bool is_playing() const

Returns `true` if an animation is currently playing (even if speed_scale
and/or `custom_speed` are `0`).

void pause()

Pauses the currently playing animation. The current_animation_position will be
kept and calling play() or play_backwards() without arguments or with the same
animation name as assigned_animation will resume the animation.

See also stop().

void play(name: StringName = &"", custom_blend: float = -1, custom_speed:
float = 1.0, from_end: bool = false)

Plays the animation with key `name`. Custom blend times and speed can be set.

The `from_end` option only affects when switching to a new animation track, or
if the same track but at the start or end. It does not affect resuming
playback that was paused in the middle of an animation. If `custom_speed` is
negative and `from_end` is `true`, the animation will play backwards (which is
equivalent to calling play_backwards()).

The AnimationPlayer keeps track of its current or last played animation with
assigned_animation. If this method is called with that same animation `name`,
or with no `name` parameter, the assigned animation will resume playing if it
was paused.

Note: The animation will be updated the next time the AnimationPlayer is
processed. If other variables are updated at the same time this is called,
they may be updated too early. To perform the update immediately, call
`advance(0)`.

void play_backwards(name: StringName = &"", custom_blend: float = -1)

Plays the animation with key `name` in reverse.

This method is a shorthand for play() with `custom_speed = -1.0` and `from_end
= true`, so see its description for more information.

void play_section(name: StringName = &"", start_time: float = -1, end_time:
float = -1, custom_blend: float = -1, custom_speed: float = 1.0, from_end:
bool = false)

Plays the animation with key `name` and the section starting from `start_time`
and ending on `end_time`. See also play().

Setting `start_time` to a value outside the range of the animation means the
start of the animation will be used instead, and setting `end_time` to a value
outside the range of the animation means the end of the animation will be used
instead. `start_time` cannot be equal to `end_time`.

void play_section_backwards(name: StringName = &"", start_time: float = -1,
end_time: float = -1, custom_blend: float = -1)

Plays the animation with key `name` and the section starting from `start_time`
and ending on `end_time` in reverse.

This method is a shorthand for play_section() with `custom_speed = -1.0` and
`from_end = true`, see its description for more information.

void play_section_with_markers(name: StringName = &"", start_marker:
StringName = &"", end_marker: StringName = &"", custom_blend: float = -1,
custom_speed: float = 1.0, from_end: bool = false)

Plays the animation with key `name` and the section starting from
`start_marker` and ending on `end_marker`.

If the start marker is empty, the section starts from the beginning of the
animation. If the end marker is empty, the section ends on the end of the
animation. See also play().

void play_section_with_markers_backwards(name: StringName = &"", start_marker:
StringName = &"", end_marker: StringName = &"", custom_blend: float = -1)

Plays the animation with key `name` and the section starting from
`start_marker` and ending on `end_marker` in reverse.

This method is a shorthand for play_section_with_markers() with `custom_speed
= -1.0` and `from_end = true`, see its description for more information.

void play_with_capture(name: StringName = &"", duration: float = -1.0,
custom_blend: float = -1, custom_speed: float = 1.0, from_end: bool = false,
trans_type: TransitionType = 0, ease_type: EaseType = 0)

See also AnimationMixer.capture().

You can use this method to use more detailed options for capture than those
performed by playback_auto_capture. When playback_auto_capture is `false`,
this method is almost the same as the following:

    
    
    capture(name, duration, trans_type, ease_type)
    play(name, custom_blend, custom_speed, from_end)
    

If `name` is blank, it specifies assigned_animation.

If `duration` is a negative value, the duration is set to the interval between
the current position and the first key, when `from_end` is `true`, uses the
interval between the current position and the last key instead.

Note: The `duration` takes speed_scale into account, but `custom_speed` does
not, because the capture cache is interpolated with the blend result and the
result may contain multiple animations.

void queue(name: StringName)

Queues an animation for playback once the current animation and all previously
queued animations are done.

Note: If a looped animation is currently playing, the queued animation will
never play unless the looped animation is stopped somehow.

void reset_section()

Resets the current section if section is set.

void seek(seconds: float, update: bool = false, update_only: bool = false)

Seeks the animation to the `seconds` point in time (in seconds). If `update`
is `true`, the animation updates too, otherwise it updates at process time.
Events between the current frame and `seconds` are skipped.

If `update_only` is `true`, the method / audio / animation playback tracks
will not be processed.

Note: Seeking to the end of the animation doesn't emit
AnimationMixer.animation_finished. If you want to skip animation and emit the
signal, use AnimationMixer.advance().

void set_blend_time(animation_from: StringName, animation_to: StringName, sec:
float)

Specifies a blend time (in seconds) between two animations, referenced by
their keys.

void set_method_call_mode(mode: AnimationMethodCallMode)

Deprecated: Use AnimationMixer.callback_mode_method instead.

Sets the call mode used for "Call Method" tracks.

void set_process_callback(mode: AnimationProcessCallback)

Deprecated: Use AnimationMixer.callback_mode_process instead.

Sets the process notification in which to update animations.

void set_root(path: NodePath)

Deprecated: Use AnimationMixer.root_node instead.

Sets the node which node path references will travel from.

void set_section(start_time: float = -1, end_time: float = -1)

Changes the start and end times of the section being played. The current
playback position will be clamped within the new section. See also
play_section().

void set_section_with_markers(start_marker: StringName = &"", end_marker:
StringName = &"")

Changes the start and end markers of the section being played. The current
playback position will be clamped within the new section. See also
play_section_with_markers().

If the argument is empty, the section uses the beginning or end of the
animation. If both are empty, it means that the section is not set.

void stop(keep_state: bool = false)

Stops the currently playing animation. The animation position is reset to `0`
and the `custom_speed` is reset to `1.0`. See also pause().

If `keep_state` is `true`, the animation state is not updated visually.

Note: The method / audio / animation playback tracks will not be processed by
this method.
