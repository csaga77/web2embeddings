# Semaphore

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

A synchronization mechanism used to control access to a shared resource by
Threads.

## Description

A synchronization semaphore that can be used to synchronize multiple Threads.
Initialized to zero on creation. For a binary version, see Mutex.

Warning: Semaphores must be used carefully to avoid deadlocks.

Warning: To guarantee that the operating system is able to perform proper
cleanup (no crashes, no deadlocks), these conditions must be met:

  * When a Semaphore's reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed, no threads must be waiting on it.

  * When a Thread's reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed, it must not be waiting on any semaphore.

## Tutorials

  * Using multiple threads

  * Thread-safe APIs

## Methods

void | post(count: int = 1)  
---|---  
bool | try_wait()  
void | wait()  
  
## Method Descriptions

void post(count: int = 1)

Lowers the Semaphore, allowing one thread in, or more if `count` is specified.

bool try_wait()

Like wait(), but won't block, so if the value is zero, fails immediately and
returns `false`. If non-zero, it returns `true` to report success.

void wait()

Waits for the Semaphore, if its value is zero, blocks until non-zero.
