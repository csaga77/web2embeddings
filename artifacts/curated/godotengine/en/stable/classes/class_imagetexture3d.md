# ImageTexture3D

Inherits: Texture3D < Texture < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Texture with 3 dimensions.

## Description

ImageTexture3D is a 3-dimensional ImageTexture that has a width, height, and
depth. See also ImageTextureLayered.

3D textures are typically used to store density maps for FogMaterial, color
correction LUTs for Environment, vector fields for
GPUParticlesAttractorVectorField3D and collision maps for
GPUParticlesCollisionSDF3D. 3D textures can also be used in custom shaders.

## Method Descriptions

Error create(format: Format, width: int, height: int, depth: int, use_mipmaps:
bool, data: Array[Image])

Creates the ImageTexture3D with specified `width`, `height`, and `depth`. See
Format for `format` options. If `use_mipmaps` is `true`, then generate mipmaps
for the ImageTexture3D.

void update(data: Array[Image])

Replaces the texture's existing data with the layers specified in `data`. The
size of `data` must match the parameters that were used for create(). In other
words, the texture cannot be resized or have its format changed by calling
update().
