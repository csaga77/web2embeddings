# TextureButton

Inherits: BaseButton < Control < CanvasItem < Node < Object

Texture-based button. Supports Pressed, Hover, Disabled and Focused states.

## Description

TextureButton has the same functionality as Button, except it uses sprites
instead of Godot's Theme resource. It is faster to create, but it doesn't
support localization like more complex Controls.

See also BaseButton which contains common properties and methods associated
with this node.

Note: Setting a texture for the "normal" state (texture_normal) is
recommended. If texture_normal is not set, the TextureButton will still
receive input events and be clickable, but the user will not be able to see it
unless they activate another one of its states with a texture assigned (e.g.,
hover over it to show texture_hover).

## Enumerations

enum StretchMode:

StretchMode STRETCH_SCALE = `0`

Scale to fit the node's bounding rectangle.

StretchMode STRETCH_TILE = `1`

Tile inside the node's bounding rectangle.

StretchMode STRETCH_KEEP = `2`

The texture keeps its original size and stays in the bounding rectangle's top-
left corner.

StretchMode STRETCH_KEEP_CENTERED = `3`

The texture keeps its original size and stays centered in the node's bounding
rectangle.

StretchMode STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT = `4`

Scale the texture to fit the node's bounding rectangle, but maintain the
texture's aspect ratio.

StretchMode STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT_CENTERED = `5`

Scale the texture to fit the node's bounding rectangle, center it, and
maintain its aspect ratio.

StretchMode STRETCH_KEEP_ASPECT_COVERED = `6`

Scale the texture so that the shorter side fits the bounding rectangle. The
other side clips to the node's limits.

## Property Descriptions

bool flip_h = `false`

  * void set_flip_h(value: bool)

  * bool is_flipped_h()

If `true`, texture is flipped horizontally.

bool flip_v = `false`

  * void set_flip_v(value: bool)

  * bool is_flipped_v()

If `true`, texture is flipped vertically.

bool ignore_texture_size = `false`

  * void set_ignore_texture_size(value: bool)

  * bool get_ignore_texture_size()

If `true`, the size of the texture won't be considered for minimum size
calculation, so the TextureButton can be shrunk down past the texture size.

StretchMode stretch_mode = `2`

  * void set_stretch_mode(value: StretchMode)

  * StretchMode get_stretch_mode()

Controls the texture's behavior when you resize the node's bounding rectangle.
See the StretchMode constants for available options.

BitMap texture_click_mask

  * void set_click_mask(value: BitMap)

  * BitMap get_click_mask()

Pure black and white BitMap image to use for click detection. On the mask,
white pixels represent the button's clickable area. Use it to create buttons
with curved shapes.

Texture2D texture_disabled

  * void set_texture_disabled(value: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture_disabled()

Texture to display when the node is disabled. See BaseButton.disabled. If not
assigned, the TextureButton displays texture_normal instead.

Texture2D texture_focused

  * void set_texture_focused(value: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture_focused()

Texture to overlay on the base texture when the node has mouse or keyboard
focus. Because texture_focused is displayed on top of the base texture, a
partially transparent texture should be used to ensure the base texture
remains visible. A texture that represents an outline or an underline works
well for this purpose. To disable the focus visual effect, assign a fully
transparent texture of any size. Note that disabling the focus visual effect
will harm keyboard/controller navigation usability, so this is not recommended
for accessibility reasons.

Texture2D texture_hover

  * void set_texture_hover(value: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture_hover()

Texture to display when the mouse hovers over the node. If not assigned, the
TextureButton displays texture_normal instead when hovered over.

Texture2D texture_normal

  * void set_texture_normal(value: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture_normal()

Texture to display by default, when the node is not in the disabled, hover or
pressed state. This texture is still displayed in the focused state, with
texture_focused drawn on top.

Texture2D texture_pressed

  * void set_texture_pressed(value: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture_pressed()

Texture to display on mouse down over the node, if the node has keyboard focus
and the player presses the Enter key or if the player presses the
BaseButton.shortcut key. If not assigned, the TextureButton displays
texture_hover instead when pressed.
