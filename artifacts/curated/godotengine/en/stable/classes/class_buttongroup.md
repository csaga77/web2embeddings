# ButtonGroup

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

A group of buttons that doesn't allow more than one button to be pressed at a
time.

## Description

A group of BaseButton-derived buttons. The buttons in a ButtonGroup are
treated like radio buttons: No more than one button can be pressed at a time.
Some types of buttons (such as CheckBox) may have a special appearance in this
state.

Every member of a ButtonGroup should have BaseButton.toggle_mode set to
`true`.
