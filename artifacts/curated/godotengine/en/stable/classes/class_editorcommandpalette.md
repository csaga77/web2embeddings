Object

Godot editor's command palette.

## Description

Object that holds all the available Commands and their shortcuts text. These
Commands can be accessed through Editor > Command Palette menu.

Command key names use slash delimiters to distinguish sections, for example:
`"example/command1"` then `example` will be the section name.

    var command_palette = EditorInterface.get_command_palette()
    # external_command is a function that will be called with the command is executed.
    var command_callable = Callable(self, "external_command").bind(arguments)
    command_palette.add_command("command", "test/command",command_callable)
    
    
    
    EditorCommandPalette commandPalette = EditorInterface.Singleton.GetCommandPalette();
    // ExternalCommand is a function that will be called with the command is executed.
    Callable commandCallable = new Callable(this, MethodName.ExternalCommand);
    commandPalette.AddCommand("command", "test/command", commandCallable)
    

Note: This class shouldn't be instantiated directly. Instead, access the
singleton using EditorInterface.get_command_palette().
