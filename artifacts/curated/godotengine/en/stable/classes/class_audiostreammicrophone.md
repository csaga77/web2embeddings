# AudioStreamMicrophone

Inherits: AudioStream < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Plays real-time audio input data.

## Description

When used directly in an AudioStreamPlayer node, AudioStreamMicrophone plays
back microphone input in real-time. This can be used in conjunction with
AudioEffectCapture to process the data or save it.

Note: ProjectSettings.audio/driver/enable_input must be `true` for audio input
to work. See also that setting's description for caveats related to
permissions and operating system privacy settings.
