# CollisionPolygon3D

Inherits: Node3D < Node < Object

A node that provides a thickened polygon shape (a prism) to a
CollisionObject3D parent.

## Description

A node that provides a thickened polygon shape (a prism) to a
CollisionObject3D parent and allows to edit it. The polygon can be concave or
convex. This can give a detection shape to an Area3D or turn PhysicsBody3D
into a solid object.

Warning: A non-uniformly scaled CollisionShape3D will likely not behave as
expected. Make sure to keep its scale the same on all axes and adjust its
shape resource instead.

## Properties

Color | debug_color | `Color(0, 0, 0, 0)`  
---|---|---  
bool | debug_fill | `true`  
float | depth | `1.0`  
bool | disabled | `false`  
float | margin | `0.04`  
PackedVector2Array | polygon | `PackedVector2Array()`  
  
## Property Descriptions

Color debug_color = `Color(0, 0, 0, 0)`

  * void set_debug_color(value: Color)

  * Color get_debug_color()

The collision shape color that is displayed in the editor, or in the running
project if Debug > Visible Collision Shapes is checked at the top of the
editor.

Note: The default value is ProjectSettings.debug/shapes/collision/shape_color.
The `Color(0, 0, 0, 0)` value documented here is a placeholder, and not the
actual default debug color.

bool debug_fill = `true`

  * void set_enable_debug_fill(value: bool)

  * bool get_enable_debug_fill()

If `true`, when the shape is displayed, it will show a solid fill color in
addition to its wireframe.

float depth = `1.0`

  * void set_depth(value: float)

  * float get_depth()

Length that the resulting collision extends in either direction perpendicular
to its 2D polygon.

bool disabled = `false`

  * void set_disabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_disabled()

If `true`, no collision will be produced.

float margin = `0.04`

  * void set_margin(value: float)

  * float get_margin()

The collision margin for the generated Shape3D. See Shape3D.margin for more
details.

PackedVector2Array polygon = `PackedVector2Array()`

  * void set_polygon(value: PackedVector2Array)

  * PackedVector2Array get_polygon()

Array of vertices which define the 2D polygon in the local XY plane.

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedVector2Array for more details.
