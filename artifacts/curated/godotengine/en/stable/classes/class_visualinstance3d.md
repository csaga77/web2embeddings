# VisualInstance3D

Inherits: Node3D < Node < Object

Parent of all visual 3D nodes.

## Description

The VisualInstance3D is used to connect a resource to a visual representation.
All visual 3D nodes inherit from the VisualInstance3D. In general, you should
not access the VisualInstance3D properties directly as they are accessed and
managed by the nodes that inherit from VisualInstance3D. VisualInstance3D is
the node representation of the RenderingServer instance.

## Property Descriptions

int layers = `1`

  * void set_layer_mask(value: int)

  * int get_layer_mask()

The render layer(s) this VisualInstance3D is drawn on.

This object will only be visible for Camera3Ds whose cull mask includes any of
the render layers this VisualInstance3D is set to.

For Light3Ds, this can be used to control which VisualInstance3Ds are affected
by a specific light. For GPUParticles3D, this can be used to control which
particles are effected by a specific attractor. For Decals, this can be used
to control which VisualInstance3Ds are affected by a specific decal.

To adjust layers more easily using a script, use get_layer_mask_value() and
set_layer_mask_value().

Note: VoxelGI, SDFGI and LightmapGI will always take all layers into account
to determine what contributes to global illumination. If this is an issue, set
GeometryInstance3D.gi_mode to GeometryInstance3D.GI_MODE_DISABLED for meshes
and Light3D.light_bake_mode to Light3D.BAKE_DISABLED for lights to exclude
them from global illumination.

float sorting_offset = `0.0`

  * void set_sorting_offset(value: float)

  * float get_sorting_offset()

The amount by which the depth of this VisualInstance3D will be adjusted when
sorting by depth. Uses the same units as the engine (which are typically
meters). Adjusting it to a higher value will make the VisualInstance3D
reliably draw on top of other VisualInstance3Ds that are otherwise positioned
at the same spot. To ensure it always draws on top of other objects around it
(not positioned at the same spot), set the value to be greater than the
distance between this VisualInstance3D and the other nearby VisualInstance3Ds.

bool sorting_use_aabb_center

  * void set_sorting_use_aabb_center(value: bool)

  * bool is_sorting_use_aabb_center()

If `true`, the object is sorted based on the AABB center. The object will be
sorted based on the global position otherwise.

The AABB center based sorting is generally more accurate for 3D models. The
position based sorting instead allows to better control the drawing order when
working with GPUParticles3D and CPUParticles3D.

## Method Descriptions

AABB _get_aabb() virtual const

There is currently no description for this method. Please help us by
contributing one!

AABB get_aabb() const

Returns the AABB (also known as the bounding box) for this VisualInstance3D.

RID get_base() const

Returns the RID of the resource associated with this VisualInstance3D. For
example, if the Node is a MeshInstance3D, this will return the RID of the
associated Mesh.

RID get_instance() const

Returns the RID of this instance. This RID is the same as the RID returned by
RenderingServer.instance_create(). This RID is needed if you want to call
RenderingServer functions directly on this VisualInstance3D.

bool get_layer_mask_value(layer_number: int) const

Returns whether or not the specified layer of the layers is enabled, given a
`layer_number` between 1 and 20.

void set_base(base: RID)

Sets the resource that is instantiated by this VisualInstance3D, which changes
how the engine handles the VisualInstance3D under the hood. Equivalent to
RenderingServer.instance_set_base().

void set_layer_mask_value(layer_number: int, value: bool)

Based on `value`, enables or disables the specified layer in the layers, given
a `layer_number` between 1 and 20.
