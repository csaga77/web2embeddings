# ImageTextureLayered

Inherits: TextureLayered < Texture < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Inherited By: Cubemap, CubemapArray, Texture2DArray

Base class for texture types which contain the data of multiple ImageTextures.
Each image is of the same size and format.

## Description

Base class for Texture2DArray, Cubemap and CubemapArray. Cannot be used
directly, but contains all the functions necessary for accessing the derived
resource types. See also Texture3D.

## Method Descriptions

Error create_from_images(images: Array[Image])

Creates an ImageTextureLayered from an array of Images. See Image.create() for
the expected data format. The first image decides the width, height, image
format and mipmapping setting. The other images must have the same width,
height, image format and mipmapping setting.

Each Image represents one `layer`.

    
    
    # Fill in an array of Images with different colors.
    var images = []
    const LAYERS = 6
    for i in LAYERS:
        var image = Image.create_empty(128, 128, false, Image.FORMAT_RGB8)
        if i % 3 == 0:
            image.fill(Color.RED)
        elif i % 3 == 1:
            image.fill(Color.GREEN)
        else:
            image.fill(Color.BLUE)
        images.push_back(image)
    
    # Create and save a 2D texture array. The array of images must have at least 1 Image.
    var texture_2d_array = Texture2DArray.new()
    texture_2d_array.create_from_images(images)
    ResourceSaver.save(texture_2d_array, "res://texture_2d_array.res", ResourceSaver.FLAG_COMPRESS)
    
    # Create and save a cubemap. The array of images must have exactly 6 Images.
    # The cubemap's images are specified in this order: X+, X-, Y+, Y-, Z+, Z-
    # (in Godot's coordinate system, so Y+ is "up" and Z- is "forward").
    var cubemap = Cubemap.new()
    cubemap.create_from_images(images)
    ResourceSaver.save(cubemap, "res://cubemap.res", ResourceSaver.FLAG_COMPRESS)
    
    # Create and save a cubemap array. The array of images must have a multiple of 6 Images.
    # Each cubemap's images are specified in this order: X+, X-, Y+, Y-, Z+, Z-
    # (in Godot's coordinate system, so Y+ is "up" and Z- is "forward").
    var cubemap_array = CubemapArray.new()
    cubemap_array.create_from_images(images)
    ResourceSaver.save(cubemap_array, "res://cubemap_array.res", ResourceSaver.FLAG_COMPRESS)
    

void update_layer(image: Image, layer: int)

Replaces the existing Image data at the given `layer` with this new image.

The given Image must have the same width, height, image format, and mipmapping
flag as the rest of the referenced images.

If the image format is unsupported, it will be decompressed and converted to a
similar and supported Format.

The update is immediate: it's synchronized with drawing.
