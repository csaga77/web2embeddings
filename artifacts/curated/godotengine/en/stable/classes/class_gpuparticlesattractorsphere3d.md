# GPUParticlesAttractorSphere3D

Inherits: GPUParticlesAttractor3D < VisualInstance3D < Node3D < Node < Object

A spheroid-shaped attractor that influences particles from GPUParticles3D
nodes.

## Description

A spheroid-shaped attractor that influences particles from GPUParticles3D
nodes. Can be used to attract particles towards its origin, or to push them
away from its origin.

Particle attractors work in real-time and can be moved, rotated and scaled
during gameplay. Unlike collision shapes, non-uniform scaling of attractors is
also supported.

Note: Particle attractors only affect GPUParticles3D, not CPUParticles3D.

## Properties

float | radius | `1.0`  
---|---|---  
  
## Property Descriptions

float radius = `1.0`

  * void set_radius(value: float)

  * float get_radius()

The attractor sphere's radius in 3D units.

Note: Stretched ellipses can be obtained by using non-uniform scaling on the
GPUParticlesAttractorSphere3D node.
