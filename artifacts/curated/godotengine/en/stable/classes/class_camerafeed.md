# CameraFeed

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

A camera feed gives you access to a single physical camera attached to your
device.

## Description

A camera feed gives you access to a single physical camera attached to your
device. When enabled, Godot will start capturing frames from the camera which
can then be used. See also CameraServer.

Note: Many cameras will return YCbCr images which are split into two textures
and need to be combined in a shader. Godot does this automatically for you if
you set the environment to show the camera image in the background.

Note: This class is currently only implemented on Linux, macOS, and iOS. On
other platforms no CameraFeeds will be available. To get a CameraFeed on iOS,
the camera plugin from godot-ios-plugins is required.

## Signals

format_changed()

Emitted when the format has changed.

frame_changed()

Emitted when a new frame is available.

## Enumerations

enum FeedDataType:

FeedDataType FEED_NOIMAGE = `0`

No image set for the feed.

FeedDataType FEED_RGB = `1`

Feed supplies RGB images.

FeedDataType FEED_YCBCR = `2`

Feed supplies YCbCr images that need to be converted to RGB.

FeedDataType FEED_YCBCR_SEP = `3`

Feed supplies separate Y and CbCr images that need to be combined and
converted to RGB.

FeedDataType FEED_EXTERNAL = `4`

Feed supplies external image.

enum FeedPosition:

FeedPosition FEED_UNSPECIFIED = `0`

Unspecified position.

FeedPosition FEED_FRONT = `1`

Camera is mounted at the front of the device.

FeedPosition FEED_BACK = `2`

Camera is mounted at the back of the device.

## Property Descriptions

bool feed_is_active = `false`

  * void set_active(value: bool)

  * bool is_active()

If `true`, the feed is active.

Transform2D feed_transform = `Transform2D(1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 1)`

  * void set_transform(value: Transform2D)

  * Transform2D get_transform()

The transform applied to the camera's image.

Array formats = `[]`

  * Array get_formats()

Formats supported by the feed. Each entry is a Dictionary describing format
parameters.

## Method Descriptions

bool _activate_feed() virtual

Called when the camera feed is activated.

void _deactivate_feed() virtual

Called when the camera feed is deactivated.

FeedDataType get_datatype() const

Returns feed image data type.

int get_id() const

Returns the unique ID for this feed.

String get_name() const

Returns the camera's name.

FeedPosition get_position() const

Returns the position of camera on the device.

int get_texture_tex_id(feed_image_type: FeedImage)

Returns the texture backend ID (usable by some external libraries that need a
handle to a texture to write data).

void set_external(width: int, height: int)

Sets the feed as external feed provided by another library.

bool set_format(index: int, parameters: Dictionary)

Sets the feed format parameters for the given index in the formats array.
Returns `true` on success. By default YUYV encoded stream is transformed to
FEED_RGB. YUYV encoded stream output format can be changed with
`parameters`.output value:

`separate` will result in FEED_YCBCR_SEP

`grayscale` will result in desaturated FEED_RGB

`copy` will result in FEED_YCBCR

void set_name(name: String)

Sets the camera's name.

void set_position(position: FeedPosition)

Sets the position of this camera.

void set_rgb_image(rgb_image: Image)

Sets RGB image for this feed.

void set_ycbcr_image(ycbcr_image: Image)

Sets YCbCr image for this feed.
