Omnidirectional light, such as a light bulb or a candle.

## Description

An Omnidirectional light is a type of Light3D that emits light in all
directions. The light is attenuated by distance and this attenuation can be
configured by changing its energy, radius, and attenuation parameters.

Note: When using the Mobile rendering method, only 8 omni lights can be
displayed on each mesh resource. Attempting to display more than 8 omni lights
on a single mesh resource will result in omni lights flickering in and out as
the camera moves. When using the Compatibility rendering method, only 8 omni
lights can be displayed on each mesh resource by default, but this can be
increased by adjusting
ProjectSettings.rendering/limits/opengl/max_lights_per_object.

Note: When using the Mobile or Compatibility rendering methods, omni lights
will only correctly affect meshes whose visibility AABB intersects with the
light's AABB. If using a shader to deform the mesh in a way that makes it go
outside its AABB, GeometryInstance3D.extra_cull_margin must be increased on
the mesh. Otherwise, the light may not be visible on the mesh.

## Properties

float | light_specular | `0.5` (overrides Light3D)  
---|---|---  
float | omni_attenuation | `1.0`  
float | omni_range | `5.0`  
ShadowMode | omni_shadow_mode | `1`  
float | shadow_normal_bias | `1.0` (overrides Light3D)  
  
## Enumerations

enum ShadowMode:

ShadowMode SHADOW_DUAL_PARABOLOID = `0`

Shadows are rendered to a dual-paraboloid texture. Faster than SHADOW_CUBE,
but lower-quality.

ShadowMode SHADOW_CUBE = `1`

Shadows are rendered to a cubemap. Slower than SHADOW_DUAL_PARABOLOID, but
higher-quality.

## Property Descriptions

float omni_attenuation = `1.0`

  * void set_param(value: float)

  * float get_param()

Controls the distance attenuation function for omnilights.

A value of `0.0` will maintain a constant brightness through most of the
range, but smoothly attenuate the light at the edge of the range. Use a value
of `2.0` for physically accurate lights as it results in the proper inverse
square attenutation.

Note: Setting attenuation to `2.0` or higher may result in distant objects
receiving minimal light, even within range. For example, with a range of
`4096`, an object at `100` units is attenuated by a factor of `0.0001`. With a
default brightness of `1`, the light would not be visible at that distance.

Note: Using negative or values higher than `10.0` may lead to unexpected
results.

float omni_range = `5.0`

  * void set_param(value: float)

  * float get_param()

The light's radius. Note that the effectively lit area may appear to be
smaller depending on the omni_attenuation in use. No matter the
omni_attenuation in use, the light will never reach anything outside this
radius.

Note: omni_range is not affected by Node3D.scale (the light's scale or its
parent's scale).

ShadowMode omni_shadow_mode = `1`

  * void set_shadow_mode(value: ShadowMode)

  * ShadowMode get_shadow_mode()

See ShadowMode.
