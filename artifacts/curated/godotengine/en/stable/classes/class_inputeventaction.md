# InputEventAction

Inherits: InputEvent < Resource < RefCounted < Object

An input event type for actions.

## Description

Contains a generic action which can be targeted from several types of inputs.
Actions and their events can be set in the Input Map tab in Project > Project
Settings, or with the InputMap class.

Note: Unlike the other InputEvent subclasses which map to unique physical
events, this virtual one is not emitted by the engine. This class is useful to
emit actions manually with Input.parse_input_event(), which are then received
in Node._input(). To check if a physical event matches an action from the
Input Map, use InputEvent.is_action() and InputEvent.is_action_pressed().

## Properties

StringName | action | `&""`  
---|---|---  
int | event_index | `-1`  
bool | pressed | `false`  
float | strength | `1.0`  
  
## Property Descriptions

StringName action = `&""`

  * void set_action(value: StringName)

  * StringName get_action()

The action's name. Actions are accessed via this String.

int event_index = `-1`

  * void set_event_index(value: int)

  * int get_event_index()

The real event index in action this event corresponds to (from events defined
for this action in the InputMap). If `-1`, a unique ID will be used and
actions pressed with this ID will need to be released with another
InputEventAction.

bool pressed = `false`

  * void set_pressed(value: bool)

  * bool is_pressed()

If `true`, the action's state is pressed. If `false`, the action's state is
released.

float strength = `1.0`

  * void set_strength(value: float)

  * float get_strength()

The action's strength between 0 and 1. This value is considered as equal to 0
if pressed is `false`. The event strength allows faking analog joypad motion
events, by specifying how strongly the joypad axis is bent or pressed.
