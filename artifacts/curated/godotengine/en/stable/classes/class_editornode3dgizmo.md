# EditorNode3DGizmo

Inherits: Node3DGizmo < RefCounted < Object

Gizmo for editing Node3D objects.

## Description

Gizmo that is used for providing custom visualization and editing (handles and
subgizmos) for Node3D objects. Can be overridden to create custom gizmos, but
for simple gizmos creating a EditorNode3DGizmoPlugin is usually recommended.

## Method Descriptions

void _begin_handle_action(id: int, secondary: bool) virtual

There is currently no description for this method. Please help us by
contributing one!

void _commit_handle(id: int, secondary: bool, restore: Variant, cancel: bool)
virtual

Override this method to commit a handle being edited (handles must have been
previously added by add_handles()). This usually means creating an UndoRedo
action for the change, using the current handle value as "do" and the
`restore` argument as "undo".

If the `cancel` argument is `true`, the `restore` value should be directly
set, without any UndoRedo action.

The `secondary` argument is `true` when the committed handle is secondary (see
add_handles() for more information).

void _commit_subgizmos(ids: PackedInt32Array, restores: Array[Transform3D],
cancel: bool) virtual

Override this method to commit a group of subgizmos being edited (see
_subgizmos_intersect_ray() and _subgizmos_intersect_frustum()). This usually
means creating an UndoRedo action for the change, using the current transforms
as "do" and the `restores` transforms as "undo".

If the `cancel` argument is `true`, the `restores` transforms should be
directly set, without any UndoRedo action.

String _get_handle_name(id: int, secondary: bool) virtual const

Override this method to return the name of an edited handle (handles must have
been previously added by add_handles()). Handles can be named for reference to
the user when editing.

The `secondary` argument is `true` when the requested handle is secondary (see
add_handles() for more information).

Variant _get_handle_value(id: int, secondary: bool) virtual const

Override this method to return the current value of a handle. This value will
be requested at the start of an edit and used as the `restore` argument in
_commit_handle().

The `secondary` argument is `true` when the requested handle is secondary (see
add_handles() for more information).

Transform3D _get_subgizmo_transform(id: int) virtual const

Override this method to return the current transform of a subgizmo. This
transform will be requested at the start of an edit and used as the `restore`
argument in _commit_subgizmos().

bool _is_handle_highlighted(id: int, secondary: bool) virtual const

Override this method to return `true` whenever the given handle should be
highlighted in the editor.

The `secondary` argument is `true` when the requested handle is secondary (see
add_handles() for more information).

void _redraw() virtual

Override this method to add all the gizmo elements whenever a gizmo update is
requested. It's common to call clear() at the beginning of this method and
then add visual elements depending on the node's properties.

void _set_handle(id: int, secondary: bool, camera: Camera3D, point: Vector2)
virtual

Override this method to update the node properties when the user drags a gizmo
handle (previously added with add_handles()). The provided `point` is the
mouse position in screen coordinates and the `camera` can be used to convert
it to raycasts.

The `secondary` argument is `true` when the edited handle is secondary (see
add_handles() for more information).

void _set_subgizmo_transform(id: int, transform: Transform3D) virtual

Override this method to update the node properties during subgizmo editing
(see _subgizmos_intersect_ray() and _subgizmos_intersect_frustum()). The
`transform` is given in the Node3D's local coordinate system.

PackedInt32Array _subgizmos_intersect_frustum(camera: Camera3D, frustum:
Array[Plane]) virtual const

Override this method to allow selecting subgizmos using mouse drag box
selection. Given a `camera` and a `frustum`, this method should return which
subgizmos are contained within the frustum. The `frustum` argument consists of
an array with all the Planes that make up the selection frustum. The returned
value should contain a list of unique subgizmo identifiers, which can have any
non-negative value and will be used in other virtual methods like
_get_subgizmo_transform() or _commit_subgizmos().

int _subgizmos_intersect_ray(camera: Camera3D, point: Vector2) virtual const

Override this method to allow selecting subgizmos using mouse clicks. Given a
`camera` and a `point` in screen coordinates, this method should return which
subgizmo should be selected. The returned value should be a unique subgizmo
identifier, which can have any non-negative value and will be used in other
virtual methods like _get_subgizmo_transform() or _commit_subgizmos().

void add_collision_segments(segments: PackedVector3Array)

Adds the specified `segments` to the gizmo's collision shape for picking. Call
this method during _redraw().

void add_collision_triangles(triangles: TriangleMesh)

Adds collision triangles to the gizmo for picking. A TriangleMesh can be
generated from a regular Mesh too. Call this method during _redraw().

void add_handles(handles: PackedVector3Array, material: Material, ids:
PackedInt32Array, billboard: bool = false, secondary: bool = false)

Adds a list of handles (points) which can be used to edit the properties of
the gizmo's Node3D. The `ids` argument can be used to specify a custom
identifier for each handle, if an empty array is passed, the ids will be
assigned automatically from the `handles` argument order.

The `secondary` argument marks the added handles as secondary, meaning they
will normally have lower selection priority than regular handles. When the
user is holding the shift key secondary handles will switch to have higher
priority than regular handles. This change in priority can be used to place
multiple handles at the same point while still giving the user control on
their selection.

There are virtual methods which will be called upon editing of these handles.
Call this method during _redraw().

void add_lines(lines: PackedVector3Array, material: Material, billboard: bool
= false, modulate: Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1))

Adds lines to the gizmo (as sets of 2 points), with a given material. The
lines are used for visualizing the gizmo. Call this method during _redraw().

void add_mesh(mesh: Mesh, material: Material = null, transform: Transform3D =
Transform3D(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0), skeleton: SkinReference =
null)

Adds a mesh to the gizmo with the specified `material`, local `transform` and
`skeleton`. Call this method during _redraw().

void add_unscaled_billboard(material: Material, default_scale: float = 1,
modulate: Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1))

Adds an unscaled billboard for visualization and selection. Call this method
during _redraw().

void clear()

Removes everything in the gizmo including meshes, collisions and handles.

Node3D get_node_3d() const

Returns the Node3D node associated with this gizmo.

EditorNode3DGizmoPlugin get_plugin() const

Returns the EditorNode3DGizmoPlugin that owns this gizmo. It's useful to
retrieve materials using EditorNode3DGizmoPlugin.get_material().

PackedInt32Array get_subgizmo_selection() const

Returns a list of the currently selected subgizmos. Can be used to highlight
selected elements during _redraw().

bool is_subgizmo_selected(id: int) const

Returns `true` if the given subgizmo is currently selected. Can be used to
highlight selected elements during _redraw().

void set_hidden(hidden: bool)

Sets the gizmo's hidden state. If `true`, the gizmo will be hidden. If
`false`, it will be shown.

void set_node_3d(node: Node)

Sets the reference Node3D node for the gizmo. `node` must inherit from Node3D.
