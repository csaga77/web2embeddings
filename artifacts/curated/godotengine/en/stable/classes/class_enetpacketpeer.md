# ENetPacketPeer

Inherits: PacketPeer < RefCounted < Object

A wrapper class for an ENetPeer.

## Description

A PacketPeer implementation representing a peer of an ENetConnection.

This class cannot be instantiated directly but can be retrieved during
ENetConnection.service() or via ENetConnection.get_peers().

Note: When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the `INTERNET` permission
in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click
deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by
Android.

## Enumerations

enum PeerState:

PeerState STATE_DISCONNECTED = `0`

The peer is disconnected.

PeerState STATE_CONNECTING = `1`

The peer is currently attempting to connect.

PeerState STATE_ACKNOWLEDGING_CONNECT = `2`

The peer has acknowledged the connection request.

PeerState STATE_CONNECTION_PENDING = `3`

The peer is currently connecting.

PeerState STATE_CONNECTION_SUCCEEDED = `4`

The peer has successfully connected, but is not ready to communicate with yet
(STATE_CONNECTED).

PeerState STATE_CONNECTED = `5`

The peer is currently connected and ready to communicate with.

PeerState STATE_DISCONNECT_LATER = `6`

The peer is slated to disconnect after it has no more outgoing packets to
send.

PeerState STATE_DISCONNECTING = `7`

The peer is currently disconnecting.

PeerState STATE_ACKNOWLEDGING_DISCONNECT = `8`

The peer has acknowledged the disconnection request.

PeerState STATE_ZOMBIE = `9`

The peer has lost connection, but is not considered truly disconnected (as the
peer didn't acknowledge the disconnection request).

enum PeerStatistic:

PeerStatistic PEER_PACKET_LOSS = `0`

Mean packet loss of reliable packets as a ratio with respect to the
PACKET_LOSS_SCALE.

PeerStatistic PEER_PACKET_LOSS_VARIANCE = `1`

Packet loss variance.

PeerStatistic PEER_PACKET_LOSS_EPOCH = `2`

The time at which packet loss statistics were last updated (in milliseconds
since the connection started). The interval for packet loss statistics updates
is 10 seconds, and at least one packet must have been sent since the last
statistics update.

PeerStatistic PEER_ROUND_TRIP_TIME = `3`

Mean packet round trip time for reliable packets.

PeerStatistic PEER_ROUND_TRIP_TIME_VARIANCE = `4`

Variance of the mean round trip time.

PeerStatistic PEER_LAST_ROUND_TRIP_TIME = `5`

Last recorded round trip time for a reliable packet.

PeerStatistic PEER_LAST_ROUND_TRIP_TIME_VARIANCE = `6`

Variance of the last trip time recorded.

PeerStatistic PEER_PACKET_THROTTLE = `7`

The peer's current throttle status.

PeerStatistic PEER_PACKET_THROTTLE_LIMIT = `8`

The maximum number of unreliable packets that should not be dropped. This
value is always greater than or equal to `1`. The initial value is equal to
PACKET_THROTTLE_SCALE.

PeerStatistic PEER_PACKET_THROTTLE_COUNTER = `9`

Internal value used to increment the packet throttle counter. The value is
hardcoded to `7` and cannot be changed. You probably want to look at
PEER_PACKET_THROTTLE_ACCELERATION instead.

PeerStatistic PEER_PACKET_THROTTLE_EPOCH = `10`

The time at which throttle statistics were last updated (in milliseconds since
the connection started). The interval for throttle statistics updates is
PEER_PACKET_THROTTLE_INTERVAL.

PeerStatistic PEER_PACKET_THROTTLE_ACCELERATION = `11`

The throttle's acceleration factor. Higher values will make ENet adapt to
fluctuating network conditions faster, causing unrelaible packets to be sent
more often. The default value is `2`.

PeerStatistic PEER_PACKET_THROTTLE_DECELERATION = `12`

The throttle's deceleration factor. Higher values will make ENet adapt to
fluctuating network conditions faster, causing unrelaible packets to be sent
less often. The default value is `2`.

PeerStatistic PEER_PACKET_THROTTLE_INTERVAL = `13`

The interval over which the lowest mean round trip time should be measured for
use by the throttle mechanism (in milliseconds). The default value is `5000`.

## Constants

PACKET_LOSS_SCALE = `65536`

The reference scale for packet loss. See get_statistic() and PEER_PACKET_LOSS.

PACKET_THROTTLE_SCALE = `32`

The reference value for throttle configuration. The default value is `32`. See
throttle_configure().

FLAG_RELIABLE = `1`

Mark the packet to be sent as reliable.

FLAG_UNSEQUENCED = `2`

Mark the packet to be sent unsequenced (unreliable).

FLAG_UNRELIABLE_FRAGMENT = `8`

Mark the packet to be sent unreliable even if the packet is too big and needs
fragmentation (increasing the chance of it being dropped).

## Method Descriptions

int get_channels() const

Returns the number of channels allocated for communication with peer.

int get_packet_flags() const

Returns the ENet flags of the next packet in the received queue. See `FLAG_*`
constants for available packet flags. Note that not all flags are replicated
from the sending peer to the receiving peer.

String get_remote_address() const

Returns the IP address of this peer.

int get_remote_port() const

Returns the remote port of this peer.

PeerState get_state() const

Returns the current peer state. See PeerState.

float get_statistic(statistic: PeerStatistic)

Returns the requested `statistic` for this peer. See PeerStatistic.

bool is_active() const

Returns `true` if the peer is currently active (i.e. the associated
ENetConnection is still valid).

void peer_disconnect(data: int = 0)

Request a disconnection from a peer. An ENetConnection.EVENT_DISCONNECT will
be generated during ENetConnection.service() once the disconnection is
complete.

void peer_disconnect_later(data: int = 0)

Request a disconnection from a peer, but only after all queued outgoing
packets are sent. An ENetConnection.EVENT_DISCONNECT will be generated during
ENetConnection.service() once the disconnection is complete.

void peer_disconnect_now(data: int = 0)

Force an immediate disconnection from a peer. No
ENetConnection.EVENT_DISCONNECT will be generated. The foreign peer is not
guaranteed to receive the disconnect notification, and is reset immediately
upon return from this function.

void ping()

Sends a ping request to a peer. ENet automatically pings all connected peers
at regular intervals, however, this function may be called to ensure more
frequent ping requests.

void ping_interval(ping_interval: int)

Sets the `ping_interval` in milliseconds at which pings will be sent to a
peer. Pings are used both to monitor the liveness of the connection and also
to dynamically adjust the throttle during periods of low traffic so that the
throttle has reasonable responsiveness during traffic spikes. The default ping
interval is `500` milliseconds.

void reset()

Forcefully disconnects a peer. The foreign host represented by the peer is not
notified of the disconnection and will timeout on its connection to the local
host.

Error send(channel: int, packet: PackedByteArray, flags: int)

Queues a `packet` to be sent over the specified `channel`. See `FLAG_*`
constants for available packet flags.

void set_timeout(timeout: int, timeout_min: int, timeout_max: int)

Sets the timeout parameters for a peer. The timeout parameters control how and
when a peer will timeout from a failure to acknowledge reliable traffic.
Timeout values are expressed in milliseconds.

The `timeout` is a factor that, multiplied by a value based on the average
round trip time, will determine the timeout limit for a reliable packet. When
that limit is reached, the timeout will be doubled, and the peer will be
disconnected if that limit has reached `timeout_min`. The `timeout_max`
parameter, on the other hand, defines a fixed timeout for which any packet
must be acknowledged or the peer will be dropped.

void throttle_configure(interval: int, acceleration: int, deceleration: int)

Configures throttle parameter for a peer.

Unreliable packets are dropped by ENet in response to the varying conditions
of the Internet connection to the peer. The throttle represents a probability
that an unreliable packet should not be dropped and thus sent by ENet to the
peer. By measuring fluctuations in round trip times of reliable packets over
the specified `interval`, ENet will either increase the probability by the
amount specified in the `acceleration` parameter, or decrease it by the amount
specified in the `deceleration` parameter (both are ratios to
PACKET_THROTTLE_SCALE).

When the throttle has a value of PACKET_THROTTLE_SCALE, no unreliable packets
are dropped by ENet, and so 100% of all unreliable packets will be sent.

When the throttle has a value of `0`, all unreliable packets are dropped by
ENet, and so 0% of all unreliable packets will be sent.

Intermediate values for the throttle represent intermediate probabilities
between 0% and 100% of unreliable packets being sent. The bandwidth limits of
the local and foreign hosts are taken into account to determine a sensible
limit for the throttle probability above which it should not raise even in the
best of conditions.
