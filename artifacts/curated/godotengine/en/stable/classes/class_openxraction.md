# OpenXRAction

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

An OpenXR action.

## Description

This resource defines an OpenXR action. Actions can be used both for inputs
(buttons, joysticks, triggers, etc.) and outputs (haptics).

OpenXR performs automatic conversion between action type and input type
whenever possible. An analog trigger bound to a boolean action will thus
return `false` if the trigger is depressed and `true` if pressed fully.

Actions are not directly bound to specific devices, instead OpenXR recognizes
a limited number of top level paths that identify devices by usage. We can
restrict which devices an action can be bound to by these top level paths. For
instance an action that should only be used for hand held controllers can have
the top level paths "/user/hand/left" and "/user/hand/right" associated with
them. See the reserved path section in the OpenXR specification for more info
on the top level paths.

Note that the name of the resource is used to register the action with.

## Enumerations

enum ActionType:

ActionType OPENXR_ACTION_BOOL = `0`

This action provides a boolean value.

ActionType OPENXR_ACTION_FLOAT = `1`

This action provides a float value between `0.0` and `1.0` for any analog
input such as triggers.

ActionType OPENXR_ACTION_VECTOR2 = `2`

This action provides a Vector2 value and can be bound to embedded trackpads
and joysticks.

ActionType OPENXR_ACTION_POSE = `3`
