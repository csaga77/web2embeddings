# Time

Inherits: Object

A singleton for working with time data.

## Description

The Time singleton allows converting time between various formats and also
getting time information from the system.

This class conforms with as many of the ISO 8601 standards as possible. All
dates follow the Proleptic Gregorian calendar. As such, the day before
`1582-10-15` is `1582-10-14`, not `1582-10-04`. The year before 1 AD (aka 1
BC) is number `0`, with the year before that (2 BC) being `-1`, etc.

Conversion methods assume "the same timezone", and do not handle timezone
conversions or DST automatically. Leap seconds are also not handled, they must
be done manually if desired. Suffixes such as "Z" are not handled, you need to
strip them away manually.

When getting time information from the system, the time can either be in the
local timezone or UTC depending on the `utc` parameter. However, the
get_unix_time_from_system() method always uses UTC as it returns the seconds
passed since the Unix epoch.

Important: The `_from_system` methods use the system clock that the user can
manually set. Never use this method for precise time calculation since its
results are subject to automatic adjustments by the user or the operating
system. Always use get_ticks_usec() or get_ticks_msec() for precise time
calculation instead, since they are guaranteed to be monotonic (i.e. never
decrease).

## Method Descriptions

Dictionary get_date_dict_from_system(utc: bool = false) const

Returns the current date as a dictionary of keys: `year`, `month`, `day`, and
`weekday`.

The returned values are in the system's local time when `utc` is `false`,
otherwise they are in UTC.

Dictionary get_date_dict_from_unix_time(unix_time_val: int) const

Converts the given Unix timestamp to a dictionary of keys: `year`, `month`,
`day`, and `weekday`.

String get_date_string_from_system(utc: bool = false) const

Returns the current date as an ISO 8601 date string (YYYY-MM-DD).

The returned values are in the system's local time when `utc` is `false`,
otherwise they are in UTC.

String get_date_string_from_unix_time(unix_time_val: int) const

Converts the given Unix timestamp to an ISO 8601 date string (YYYY-MM-DD).

Dictionary get_datetime_dict_from_datetime_string(datetime: String, weekday:
bool) const

Converts the given ISO 8601 date and time string (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS) to a
dictionary of keys: `year`, `month`, `day`, `weekday`, `hour`, `minute`, and
`second`.

If `weekday` is `false`, then the `weekday` entry is excluded (the calculation
is relatively expensive).

Note: Any decimal fraction in the time string will be ignored silently.

Dictionary get_datetime_dict_from_system(utc: bool = false) const

Returns the current date as a dictionary of keys: `year`, `month`, `day`,
`weekday`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`, and `dst` (Daylight Savings Time).

Dictionary get_datetime_dict_from_unix_time(unix_time_val: int) const

Converts the given Unix timestamp to a dictionary of keys: `year`, `month`,
`day`, `weekday`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second`.

The returned Dictionary's values will be the same as the
get_datetime_dict_from_system() if the Unix timestamp is the current time,
with the exception of Daylight Savings Time as it cannot be determined from
the epoch.

String get_datetime_string_from_datetime_dict(datetime: Dictionary, use_space:
bool) const

Converts the given dictionary of keys to an ISO 8601 date and time string
(YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS).

The given dictionary can be populated with the following keys: `year`,
`month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second`. Any other entries (including
`dst`) are ignored.

If the dictionary is empty, `0` is returned. If some keys are omitted, they
default to the equivalent values for the Unix epoch timestamp 0 (1970-01-01 at
00:00:00).

If `use_space` is `true`, the date and time bits are separated by an empty
space character instead of the letter T.

String get_datetime_string_from_system(utc: bool = false, use_space: bool =
false) const

Returns the current date and time as an ISO 8601 date and time string (YYYY-
MM-DDTHH:MM:SS).

The returned values are in the system's local time when `utc` is `false`,
otherwise they are in UTC.

If `use_space` is `true`, the date and time bits are separated by an empty
space character instead of the letter T.

String get_datetime_string_from_unix_time(unix_time_val: int, use_space: bool
= false) const

Converts the given Unix timestamp to an ISO 8601 date and time string (YYYY-
MM-DDTHH:MM:SS).

If `use_space` is `true`, the date and time bits are separated by an empty
space character instead of the letter T.

String get_offset_string_from_offset_minutes(offset_minutes: int) const

Converts the given timezone offset in minutes to a timezone offset string. For
example, -480 returns "-08:00", 345 returns "+05:45", and 0 returns "+00:00".

int get_ticks_msec() const

Returns the amount of time passed in milliseconds since the engine started.

Will always be positive or 0 and uses a 64-bit value (it will wrap after
roughly 500 million years).

int get_ticks_usec() const

Returns the amount of time passed in microseconds since the engine started.

Will always be positive or 0 and uses a 64-bit value (it will wrap after
roughly half a million years).

Dictionary get_time_dict_from_system(utc: bool = false) const

Returns the current time as a dictionary of keys: `hour`, `minute`, and
`second`.

The returned values are in the system's local time when `utc` is `false`,
otherwise they are in UTC.

Dictionary get_time_dict_from_unix_time(unix_time_val: int) const

Converts the given time to a dictionary of keys: `hour`, `minute`, and
`second`.

String get_time_string_from_system(utc: bool = false) const

Returns the current time as an ISO 8601 time string (HH:MM:SS).

The returned values are in the system's local time when `utc` is `false`,
otherwise they are in UTC.

String get_time_string_from_unix_time(unix_time_val: int) const

Converts the given Unix timestamp to an ISO 8601 time string (HH:MM:SS).

Dictionary get_time_zone_from_system() const

Returns the current time zone as a dictionary of keys: `bias` and `name`.

  * `bias` is the offset from UTC in minutes, since not all time zones are multiples of an hour from UTC.

  * `name` is the localized name of the time zone, according to the OS locale settings of the current user.

int get_unix_time_from_datetime_dict(datetime: Dictionary) const

Converts a dictionary of time values to a Unix timestamp.

The given dictionary can be populated with the following keys: `year`,
`month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second`. Any other entries (including
`dst`) are ignored.

If the dictionary is empty, `0` is returned. If some keys are omitted, they
default to the equivalent values for the Unix epoch timestamp 0 (1970-01-01 at
00:00:00).

You can pass the output from get_datetime_dict_from_unix_time() directly into
this function and get the same as what was put in.

Note: Unix timestamps are often in UTC. This method does not do any timezone
conversion, so the timestamp will be in the same timezone as the given
datetime dictionary.

int get_unix_time_from_datetime_string(datetime: String) const

Converts the given ISO 8601 date and/or time string to a Unix timestamp. The
string can contain a date only, a time only, or both.

Note: Unix timestamps are often in UTC. This method does not do any timezone
conversion, so the timestamp will be in the same timezone as the given
datetime string.

Note: Any decimal fraction in the time string will be ignored silently.

float get_unix_time_from_system() const

Returns the current Unix timestamp in seconds based on the system time in UTC.
This method is implemented by the operating system and always returns the time
in UTC. The Unix timestamp is the number of seconds passed since 1970-01-01 at
00:00:00, the Unix epoch.

Note: Unlike other methods that use integer timestamps, this method returns
the timestamp as a float for sub-second precision.
