# RenderingServer

Inherits: Object

Server for anything visible.

## Description

The rendering server is the API backend for everything visible. The whole
scene system mounts on it to display. The rendering server is completely
opaque: the internals are entirely implementation-specific and cannot be
accessed.

The rendering server can be used to bypass the scene/Node system entirely.
This can improve performance in cases where the scene system is the
bottleneck, but won't improve performance otherwise (for instance, if the GPU
is already fully utilized).

Resources are created using the `*_create` functions. These functions return
RIDs which are not references to the objects themselves, but opaque pointers
towards these objects.

All objects are drawn to a viewport. You can use the Viewport attached to the
SceneTree or you can create one yourself with viewport_create(). When using a
custom scenario or canvas, the scenario or canvas needs to be attached to the
viewport using viewport_set_scenario() or viewport_attach_canvas().

Scenarios: In 3D, all visual objects must be associated with a scenario. The
scenario is a visual representation of the world. If accessing the rendering
server from a running game, the scenario can be accessed from the scene tree
from any Node3D node with Node3D.get_world_3d(). Otherwise, a scenario can be
created with scenario_create().

Similarly, in 2D, a canvas is needed to draw all canvas items.

3D: In 3D, all visible objects are comprised of a resource and an instance. A
resource can be a mesh, a particle system, a light, or any other 3D object. In
order to be visible resources must be attached to an instance using
instance_set_base(). The instance must also be attached to the scenario using
instance_set_scenario() in order to be visible. RenderingServer methods that
don't have a prefix are usually 3D-specific (but not always).

2D: In 2D, all visible objects are some form of canvas item. In order to be
visible, a canvas item needs to be the child of a canvas attached to a
viewport, or it needs to be the child of another canvas item that is
eventually attached to the canvas. 2D-specific RenderingServer methods
generally start with `canvas_*`.

Headless mode: Starting the engine with the `--headless` command line argument
disables all rendering and window management functions. Most functions from
RenderingServer will return dummy values in this case.

Mask of custom format bits per custom channel. Must be shifted by one of the
SHIFT constants. See ArrayCustomFormat.

ArrayFormat ARRAY_COMPRESS_FLAGS_BASE = `25`

Flag used to mark that the array contains 2D vertices.

ArrayFormat ARRAY_FLAG_USE_DYNAMIC_UPDATE = `67108864`

Vulkan.

ArrayFormat ARRAY_FLAG_USE_8_BONE_WEIGHTS = `134217728`

Flag used to mark that the array uses 8 bone weights instead of 4.

ArrayFormat ARRAY_FLAG_USES_EMPTY_VERTEX_ARRAY = `268435456`

Flag used to mark that the mesh does not have a vertex array and instead will
infer vertex positions in the shader using indices and other information.

ArrayFormat ARRAY_FLAG_COMPRESS_ATTRIBUTES = `536870912`

Flag used to mark that a mesh is using compressed attributes (vertices,
normals, tangents, UVs). When this form of compression is enabled, vertex
positions will be packed into an RGBA16UNORM attribute and scaled in the
vertex shader. The normal and tangent will be packed into an RG16UNORM
representing an axis, and a 16-bit float stored in the A-channel of the
vertex. UVs will use 16-bit normalized floats instead of full 32-bit signed
floats. When using this compression mode you must use either vertices,
normals, and tangents or only vertices. You cannot use normals without
tangents. Importers will automatically enable this compression if they can.

ArrayFormat ARRAY_FLAG_FORMAT_VERSION_BASE = `35`

Flag used to mark the start of the bits used to store the mesh version.

Flag used to record the format used by prior mesh versions before the
introduction of a version.

ArrayFormat ARRAY_FLAG_FORMAT_VERSION_2 = `34359738368`

Flag used to record the second iteration of the mesh version flag. The primary
difference between this and ARRAY_FLAG_FORMAT_VERSION_1 is that this version
supports ARRAY_FLAG_COMPRESS_ATTRIBUTES and in this version vertex positions
are de-interleaved from normals and tangents.

ArrayFormat ARRAY_FLAG_FORMAT_CURRENT_VERSION = `34359738368`

Flag used to record the current version that the engine expects. Currently
this is the same as ARRAY_FLAG_FORMAT_VERSION_2.

ArrayFormat ARRAY_FLAG_FORMAT_VERSION_MASK = `255`

cost as not using mipmaps.

LightProjectorFilter LIGHT_PROJECTOR_FILTER_NEAREST_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC = `4`

Nearest-neighbor filter for light projectors (use for pixel art light
projectors). Anisotropic mipmaps are used for rendering, which means light
projectors at a distance will look smooth and sharp when viewed from oblique
angles. This looks better compared to isotropic mipmaps, but is slower. The
level of anisotropic filtering is defined by
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/default_filters/anisotropic_filtering_level.

The spotlight's angle.

LightParam LIGHT_PARAM_SPOT_ATTENUATION = `8`

The spotlight's attenuation.

LightParam LIGHT_PARAM_SHADOW_MAX_DISTANCE = `9`

The maximum distance for shadow splits. Increasing this value will make
directional shadows visible from further away, at the cost of lower overall
shadow detail and performance (since more objects need to be included in the
directional shadow rendering).

Proportion of shadow atlas occupied by the first split.

LightParam LIGHT_PARAM_SHADOW_SPLIT_2_OFFSET = `11`

Proportion of shadow atlas occupied by the second split.

Sets the size of the directional shadow pancake. The pancake offsets the start
of the shadow's camera frustum to provide a higher effective depth resolution
for the shadow. However, a high pancake size can cause artifacts in the
shadows of large objects that are close to the edge of the frustum. Reducing
the pancake size can help. Setting the size to `0` turns off the pancaking
effect.

LightParam LIGHT_PARAM_SHADOW_OPACITY = `17`

through shadows. This can be used to fake global illumination at a low
performance cost.

LightParam LIGHT_PARAM_SHADOW_BLUR = `18`

contributing one!

LightParam LIGHT_PARAM_INTENSITY = `20`

`true`.

LightParam LIGHT_PARAM_MAX = `21`

Represents the size of the LightParam enum.

enum LightBakeMode:

LightBakeMode LIGHT_BAKE_DISABLED = `0`

Light is ignored when baking. This is the fastest mode, but the light will be
taken into account when baking global illumination. This mode should generally
be used for dynamic lights that change quickly, as the effect of global
illumination is less noticeable on those lights.

LightBakeMode LIGHT_BAKE_STATIC = `1`

Light is taken into account in static baking (VoxelGI, LightmapGI, SDFGI
(Environment.sdfgi_enabled)). The light can be moved around or modified, but
its global illumination will not update in real-time. This is suitable for
subtle changes (such as flickering torches), but generally not large changes
such as toggling a light on and off.

LightBakeMode LIGHT_BAKE_DYNAMIC = `2`

Light is taken into account in dynamic baking (VoxelGI and SDFGI
(Environment.sdfgi_enabled) only). The light can be moved around or modified
with global illumination updating in real-time. The light's global
illumination appearance will be slightly different compared to
LIGHT_BAKE_STATIC. This has a greater performance cost compared to
LIGHT_BAKE_STATIC. When using SDFGI, the update speed of dynamic lights is
affected by

Lowest shadow filtering quality (fastest). Soft shadows are not available with
this quality setting, which means the Light3D.shadow_blur property is ignored
if Light3D.light_size and Light3D.light_angular_distance is `0.0`.

Note: The variable shadow blur performed by Light3D.light_size and
Light3D.light_angular_distance is still effective when using hard shadow
filtering. In this case, Light3D.shadow_blur is taken into account. However,
the results will not be blurred, instead the blur amount is treated as a
maximum radius for the penumbra.

ShadowQuality SHADOW_QUALITY_SOFT_VERY_LOW = `1`

Very low shadow filtering quality (faster). When using this quality setting,
Light3D.shadow_blur is automatically multiplied by 0.75 to avoid introducing

Low shadow filtering quality (fast).

ShadowQuality SHADOW_QUALITY_SOFT_MEDIUM = `3`

Medium low shadow filtering quality (average).

ShadowQuality SHADOW_QUALITY_SOFT_HIGH = `4`

High low shadow filtering quality (slow). When using this quality setting,
Light3D.shadow_blur is automatically multiplied by 1.5 to better make use of
the high sample count. This increased blur also improves the stability of
dynamic object shadows. This multiplier only applies to lights whose
Light3D.light_size or Light3D.light_angular_distance is `0.0`).

ShadowQuality SHADOW_QUALITY_SOFT_ULTRA = `5`

Highest low shadow filtering quality (slowest). When using this quality
setting, Light3D.shadow_blur is automatically multiplied by 2 to better make
use of the high sample count. This increased blur also improves the stability
of dynamic object shadows. This multiplier only applies to lights whose
Light3D.light_size or Light3D.light_angular_distance is `0.0`).

for rendering, which means decals at a distance will look smooth but blurry.
This has roughly the same performance cost as using mipmaps.

ViewportDebugDraw VIEWPORT_DEBUG_DRAW_OVERDRAW = `3`

Objects are displayed semi-transparent with additive blending so you can see
where they are drawing over top of one another. A higher overdraw (represented
by brighter colors) means you are wasting performance on drawing pixels that
are being hidden behind others.

Note: When using this debug draw mode, custom shaders will be ignored. This
means vertex displacement won't be visible anymore.

ViewportDebugDraw VIEWPORT_DEBUG_DRAW_WIREFRAME = `4`

enum SkyMode:

SkyMode SKY_MODE_AUTOMATIC = `0`

Automatically selects the appropriate process mode based on your sky shader.
If your shader uses `TIME` or `POSITION`, this will use SKY_MODE_REALTIME. If
your shader uses any of the `LIGHT_*` variables or any custom uniforms, this
uses SKY_MODE_INCREMENTAL. Otherwise, this defaults to SKY_MODE_QUALITY.

SkyMode SKY_MODE_QUALITY = `1`

Uses high quality importance sampling to process the radiance map. In general,
this results in much higher quality than SKY_MODE_REALTIME but takes much
longer to generate. This should not be used if you plan on changing the sky at
runtime. If you are finding that the reflection is not blurry enough and is
showing sparkles or fireflies, try increasing
ProjectSettings.rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/ggx_samples.

SkyMode SKY_MODE_INCREMENTAL = `2`

Uses the same high quality importance sampling to process the radiance map as
SKY_MODE_QUALITY, but updates over several frames. The number of frames is
determined by
ProjectSettings.rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/roughness_layers. Use
this when you need highest quality radiance maps, but have a sky that updates
slowly.

SkyMode SKY_MODE_REALTIME = `3`

Uses the fast filtering algorithm to process the radiance map. In general this
results in lower quality, but substantially faster run times. If you need
better quality, but still need to update the sky every frame, consider turning
on
ProjectSettings.rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/fast_filter_high_quality.

Note: The fast filtering algorithm is limited to 256256 cubemaps, so
sky_set_radiance_size() must be set to `256`. Otherwise, a warning is printed
and the overridden radiance size is ignored.

realistic appearance. Better than other tonemappers at maintaining the hue of
colors as they become brighter. The slowest tonemapping option.

Note: Environment.tonemap_white is fixed at a value of `16.29`, which makes

enum CanvasItemTextureFilter:

CanvasItemTextureFilter CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_FILTER_DEFAULT = `0`

Uses the default filter mode for this Viewport.

CanvasItemTextureFilter CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST = `1`

The texture filter reads from the nearest pixel only. This makes the texture
look pixelated from up close, and grainy from a distance (due to mipmaps not
being sampled).

CanvasItemTextureFilter CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR = `2`

The texture filter blends between the nearest 4 pixels. This makes the texture
look smooth from up close, and grainy from a distance (due to mipmaps not
being sampled).

CanvasItemTextureFilter CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST_WITH_MIPMAPS = `3`

The texture filter reads from the nearest pixel and blends between the nearest
2 mipmaps (or uses the nearest mipmap if
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/default_filters/use_nearest_mipmap_filter
is `true`). This makes the texture look pixelated from up close, and smooth
from a distance.

Use this for non-pixel art textures that may be viewed at a low scale (e.g.
due to Camera2D zoom or sprite scaling), as mipmaps are important to smooth
out pixels that are smaller than on-screen pixels.

CanvasItemTextureFilter CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_WITH_MIPMAPS = `4`

The texture filter blends between the nearest 4 pixels and between the nearest
2 mipmaps (or uses the nearest mipmap if
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/default_filters/use_nearest_mipmap_filter
is `true`). This makes the texture look smooth from up close, and smooth from
a distance.

Use this for non-pixel art textures that may be viewed at a low scale (e.g.
due to Camera2D zoom or sprite scaling), as mipmaps are important to smooth
out pixels that are smaller than on-screen pixels.

CanvasItemTextureFilter
CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC = `5`

The texture filter reads from the nearest pixel and blends between 2 mipmaps
(or uses the nearest mipmap if
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/default_filters/use_nearest_mipmap_filter
is `true`) based on the angle between the surface and the camera view. This
makes the texture look pixelated from up close, and smooth from a distance.
Anisotropic filtering improves texture quality on surfaces that are almost in
line with the camera, but is slightly slower. The anisotropic filtering level
can be changed by adjusting
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/default_filters/anisotropic_filtering_level.

Note: This texture filter is rarely useful in 2D projects.
CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST_WITH_MIPMAPS is usually more appropriate in
this case.

CanvasItemTextureFilter
CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC = `6`

The texture filter blends between the nearest 4 pixels and blends between 2
mipmaps (or uses the nearest mipmap if
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/default_filters/use_nearest_mipmap_filter
is `true`) based on the angle between the surface and the camera view. This
makes the texture look smooth from up close, and smooth from a distance.
Anisotropic filtering improves texture quality on surfaces that are almost in
line with the camera, but is slightly slower. The anisotropic filtering level
can be changed by adjusting
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/default_filters/anisotropic_filtering_level.

Note: This texture filter is rarely useful in 2D projects.
CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_WITH_MIPMAPS is usually more appropriate in
this case.

CanvasItemTextureRepeat CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_REPEAT_DISABLED = `1`

Disables textures repeating. Instead, when reading UVs outside the 0-1 range,
the value will be clamped to the edge of the texture, resulting in a stretched
out look at the borders of the texture.

CanvasItemTextureRepeat CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_REPEAT_ENABLED = `2`

Enables the texture to repeat when UV coordinates are outside the 0-1 range.
If using one of the linear filtering modes, this can result in artifacts at
the edges of a texture when the sampler filters across the edges of the
texture.

CanvasItemTextureRepeat CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_REPEAT_MIRROR = `3`

Flip the texture when repeating so that the edge lines up instead of abruptly
changing.

## Property Descriptions

bool render_loop_enabled

  * void set_render_loop_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_render_loop_enabled()

If `false`, disables rendering completely, but the engine logic is still being
processed. You can call force_draw() to draw a frame even with rendering
disabled.

## Method Descriptions

Array[Image] bake_render_uv2(base: RID, material_overrides: Array[RID],
image_size: Vector2i)

Bakes the material data of the Mesh passed in the `base` parameter with
optional `material_overrides` to a set of Images of size `image_size`. Returns
an array of Images containing material properties as specified in
BakeChannels.

void call_on_render_thread(callable: Callable)

As the RenderingServer actual logic may run on an separate thread, accessing
its internals from the main (or any other) thread will result in errors. To
make it easier to run code that can safely access the rendering internals
(such as RenderingDevice and similar RD classes), push a callable via this
function so it will be executed on the render thread.

RID camera_attributes_create()

Creates a camera attributes object and adds it to the RenderingServer. It can
be accessed with the RID that is returned. This RID will be used in all
`camera_attributes_` RenderingServer functions.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingServer's free_rid() method.

Note: The equivalent resource is CameraAttributes.

void camera_attributes_set_auto_exposure(camera_attributes: RID, enable: bool,
min_sensitivity: float, max_sensitivity: float, speed: float, scale: float)

Sets the parameters to use with the auto-exposure effect. These parameters
take on the same meaning as their counterparts in CameraAttributes and
CameraAttributesPractical.

void camera_attributes_set_dof_blur(camera_attributes: RID, far_enable: bool,
far_distance: float, far_transition: float, near_enable: bool, near_distance:
float, near_transition: float, amount: float)

Sets the parameters to use with the DOF blur effect. These parameters take on
the same meaning as their counterparts in CameraAttributesPractical.

void camera_attributes_set_dof_blur_bokeh_shape(shape: DOFBokehShape)

Sets the shape of the DOF bokeh pattern. Different shapes may be used to
achieve artistic effect, or to meet performance targets. For more detail on
available options see DOFBokehShape.

void camera_attributes_set_dof_blur_quality(quality: DOFBlurQuality,
use_jitter: bool)

Sets the quality level of the DOF blur effect to one of the options in
DOFBlurQuality. `use_jitter` can be used to jitter samples taken during the
blur pass to hide artifacts at the cost of looking more fuzzy.

void camera_attributes_set_exposure(camera_attributes: RID, multiplier: float,
normalization: float)

Sets the exposure values that will be used by the renderers. The normalization
amount is used to bake a given Exposure Value (EV) into rendering calculations
to reduce the dynamic range of the scene.

The normalization factor can be calculated from exposure value (EV100) as
follows:

    
    
    func get_exposure_normalization(ev100: float):
        return 1.0 / (pow(2.0, ev100) * 1.2)
    

The exposure value can be calculated from aperture (in f-stops), shutter speed
(in seconds), and sensitivity (in ISO) as follows:

    
    
    func get_exposure(aperture: float, shutter_speed: float, sensitivity: float):
        return log((aperture * aperture) / shutter_speed * (100.0 / sensitivity)) / log(2)
    

RID camera_create()

3D layers are rendered by this camera. Equivalent to Camera3D.cull_mask.

void camera_set_environment(camera: RID, env: RID)

Sets the environment used by this camera. Equivalent to Camera3D.environment.

void camera_set_frustum(camera: RID, size: float, offset: Vector2, z_near:
float, z_far: float)

Sets camera to use frustum projection. This mode allows adjusting the `offset`
argument to create "tilted frustum" effects.

void camera_set_orthogonal(camera: RID, size: float, z_near: float, z_far:
float)

Sets camera to use orthogonal projection, also known as orthographic
projection. Objects remain the same size on the screen no matter how far away
they are.

void camera_set_perspective(camera: RID, fovy_degrees: float, z_near: float,
z_far: float)

Sets camera to use perspective projection. Objects on the screen becomes
smaller when they are far away.

void camera_set_transform(camera: RID, transform: Transform3D)

Sets Transform3D of camera.

void camera_set_use_vertical_aspect(camera: RID, enable: bool)

If `true`, preserves the horizontal aspect ratio which is equivalent to
Camera3D.KEEP_WIDTH. If `false`, preserves the vertical aspect ratio which is
equivalent to Camera3D.KEEP_HEIGHT.

RID canvas_create()

Creates a canvas and returns the assigned RID. It can be accessed with the RID
that is returned. This RID will be used in all `canvas_*` RenderingServer
functions.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingServer's free_rid() method.

Canvas has no Resource or Node equivalent.

void canvas_item_add_animation_slice(item: RID, animation_length: float,
slice_begin: float, slice_end: float, offset: float = 0.0)

Subsequent drawing commands will be ignored unless they fall within the

loop on background rather than redrawing constantly.

void canvas_item_add_circle(item: RID, pos: Vector2, radius: float, color:
Color, antialiased: bool = false)

Draws a circle on the CanvasItem pointed to by the `item` RID. See also

more flexibility (such as being able to use bones), use
canvas_item_add_triangle_array() instead. See also CanvasItem.draw_polygon().

Note: If you frequently redraw the same polygon with a large number of
vertices, consider pre-calculating the triangulation with
Geometry2D.triangulate_polygon() and using CanvasItem.draw_mesh(),
CanvasItem.draw_multimesh(), or canvas_item_add_triangle_array().

void canvas_item_add_polyline(item: RID, points: PackedVector2Array, colors:
PackedColorArray, width: float = -1.0, antialiased: bool = false)

Draws a 2D polyline on the CanvasItem pointed to by the `item` RID. See also

works only with axis-aligned rectangles. This means that rotation is ignored
by the clipping rectangle. For more advanced clipping shapes, use
canvas_item_set_canvas_group_mode() instead.

Note: The equivalent node functionality is found in Label.clip_text,
RichTextLabel (always enabled) and more.

void canvas_item_set_visibility_notifier(item: RID, enable: bool, area: Rect2,
enter_callable: Callable, exit_callable: Callable)

Sets the given CanvasItem as visibility notifier. `area` defines the area of
detecting visibility. `enter_callable` is called when the CanvasItem enters
the screen, `exit_callable` is called when the CanvasItem exits the screen. If
`enable` is `false`, the item will no longer function as notifier.

This method can be used to manually mimic VisibleOnScreenNotifier2D.

void canvas_item_set_visible(item: RID, visible: bool)

Sets the visibility of the CanvasItem.

void canvas_item_set_z_as_relative_to_parent(item: RID, enabled: bool)

Vector2i)

Generates and returns an Image containing the radiance map for the specified
`environment` RID's sky. This supports built-in sky material and custom sky
shaders. If `bake_irradiance` is `true`, the irradiance map is saved instead
of the radiance map. The radiance map is used to render reflected light, while
the irradiance map is used to render ambient light. See also

performed, which means it will look too dark if viewed directly in an image
editor.

Note: `size` should be a 2:1 aspect ratio for the generated panorama to have
square pixels. For radiance maps, there is no point in using a height greater
than Sky.radiance_size, as it won't increase detail. Irradiance maps only
contain low-frequency data, so there is usually no point in going past a size
of 12864 pixels when saving an irradiance map.

Sets the variables to be used with the volumetric fog post-process effect. See
Environment for more details.

void environment_set_volumetric_fog_filter_active(active: bool)

Enables filtering of the volumetric fog scattering buffer. This results in
much smoother volumes with very few under-sampling artifacts.

void environment_set_volumetric_fog_volume_size(size: int, depth: int)

Sets the resolution of the volumetric fog's froxel buffer. `size` is modified
by the screen's aspect ratio and then used to set the width and height of the
buffer. While `depth` is directly used to set the depth of the buffer.

RID fog_volume_create()

Creates a new fog volume and adds it to the RenderingServer. It can be
accessed with the RID that is returned. This RID will be used in all
`fog_volume_*` RenderingServer functions.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingServer's free_rid() method.

Note: The equivalent node is FogVolume.

void fog_volume_set_material(fog_volume: RID, material: RID)

Sets the Material of the fog volume. Can be either a FogMaterial or a custom
ShaderMaterial.

void fog_volume_set_shape(fog_volume: RID, shape: FogVolumeShape)

Sets the shape of the fog volume to either FOG_VOLUME_SHAPE_ELLIPSOID,
FOG_VOLUME_SHAPE_CONE, FOG_VOLUME_SHAPE_CYLINDER, FOG_VOLUME_SHAPE_BOX or
FOG_VOLUME_SHAPE_WORLD.

void fog_volume_set_size(fog_volume: RID, size: Vector3)

Sets the size of the fog volume when shape is FOG_VOLUME_SHAPE_ELLIPSOID,
FOG_VOLUME_SHAPE_CONE, FOG_VOLUME_SHAPE_CYLINDER or FOG_VOLUME_SHAPE_BOX.

void force_draw(swap_buffers: bool = true, frame_step: float = 0.0)

Forces redrawing of all viewports at once. Must be called from the main
thread.

void force_sync()

Forces a synchronization between the CPU and GPU, which may be required in
certain cases. Only call this when needed, as CPU-GPU synchronization has a
performance cost.

void free_rid(rid: RID)

Tries to free an object in the RenderingServer. To avoid memory leaks, this
should be called after using an object as memory management does not occur
automatically when using RenderingServer directly.

String get_current_rendering_driver_name() const

Returns the name of the current rendering driver. This can be `vulkan`,
`d3d12`, `metal`, `opengl3`, `opengl3_es`, or `opengl3_angle`. See also
get_current_rendering_method().

The rendering driver is determined by
ProjectSettings.rendering/rendering_device/driver, the `--rendering-driver`
command line argument that overrides this project setting, or an automatic
fallback that is applied depending on the hardware.

String get_current_rendering_method() const

Returns the name of the current rendering method. This can be `forward_plus`,
`mobile`, or `gl_compatibility`. See also get_current_rendering_driver_name().

The rendering method is determined by
ProjectSettings.rendering/renderer/rendering_method, the `--rendering-method`
command line argument that overrides this project setting, or an automatic
fallback that is applied depending on the hardware.

Color get_default_clear_color()

Returns the default clear color which is used when a specific clear color has
not been selected. See also set_default_clear_color().

float get_frame_setup_time_cpu() const

Returns the time taken to setup rendering on the CPU in milliseconds. This
value is shared across all viewports and does not require
viewport_set_measure_render_time() to be enabled on a viewport to be queried.
See also viewport_get_measured_render_time_cpu().

RenderingDevice get_rendering_device() const

Returns the global RenderingDevice.

Note: When using the OpenGL rendering driver or when running in headless mode,
this function always returns `null`.

int get_rendering_info(info: RenderingInfo)

Returns a statistic about the rendering engine which can be used for
performance profiling. See RenderingInfo for a list of values that can be
queried. See also viewport_get_render_info(), which returns information
specific to a viewport.

Note: Only 3D rendering is currently taken into account by some of these
values, such as the number of draw calls.

Note: Rendering information is not available until at least 2 frames have been
rendered by the engine. If rendering information is not available,
get_rendering_info() returns `0`. To print rendering information in `_ready()`
successfully, use the following:

    
    
    func _ready():
        for _i in 2:
            await get_tree().process_frame
    
        print(RenderingServer.get_rendering_info(RENDERING_INFO_TOTAL_DRAW_CALLS_IN_FRAME))
    

Array[Dictionary] get_shader_parameter_list(shader: RID) const

Returns the parameters of a shader.

RID get_test_cube()

Returns the RID of the test cube. This mesh will be created and returned on
the first call to get_test_cube(), then it will be cached for subsequent
calls. See also make_sphere_mesh().

RID get_test_texture()

Returns the RID of a 256256 texture with a testing pattern on it (in
Image.FORMAT_RGB8 format). This texture will be created and returned on the
first call to get_test_texture(), then it will be cached for subsequent calls.
See also get_white_texture().

Example: Get the test texture and apply it to a Sprite2D node:

    
    
    var texture_rid = RenderingServer.get_test_texture()
    var texture = ImageTexture.create_from_image(RenderingServer.texture_2d_get(texture_rid))
    $Sprite2D.texture = texture
    

String get_video_adapter_api_version() const

Returns the version of the graphics video adapter currently in use (e.g.
"1.2.189" for Vulkan, "3.3.0 NVIDIA 510.60.02" for OpenGL). This version may
be different from the actual latest version supported by the hardware, as
Godot may not always request the latest version. See also
OS.get_video_adapter_driver_info().

Note: When running a headless or server binary, this function returns an empty
string.

String get_video_adapter_name() const

Returns the name of the video adapter (e.g. "GeForce GTX 1080/PCIe/SSE2").

Note: When running a headless or server binary, this function returns an empty
string.

Note: On the web platform, some browsers such as Firefox may report a
different, fixed GPU name such as "GeForce GTX 980" (regardless of the user's
actual GPU model). This is done to make fingerprinting more difficult.

DeviceType get_video_adapter_type() const

Returns the type of the video adapter. Since dedicated graphics cards from a
given generation will usually be significantly faster than integrated graphics
made in the same generation, the device type can be used as a basis for
automatic graphics settings adjustment. However, this is not always true, so
make sure to provide users with a way to manually override graphics settings.

Note: When using the OpenGL rendering driver or when running in headless mode,
this function always returns RenderingDevice.DEVICE_TYPE_OTHER.

String get_video_adapter_vendor() const

Returns the vendor of the video adapter (e.g. "NVIDIA Corporation").

Note: When running a headless or server binary, this function returns an empty
string.

RID get_white_texture()

Returns the ID of a 44 white texture (in Image.FORMAT_RGB8 format). This
texture will be created and returned on the first call to get_white_texture(),
then it will be cached for subsequent calls. See also get_test_texture().

Example: Get the white texture and apply it to a Sprite2D node:

    
    
    var texture_rid = RenderingServer.get_white_texture()
    var texture = ImageTexture.create_from_image(RenderingServer.texture_2d_get(texture_rid))
    $Sprite2D.texture = texture
    

void gi_set_use_half_resolution(half_resolution: bool)

If `half_resolution` is `true`, renders VoxelGI and SDFGI
(Environment.sdfgi_enabled) buffers at halved resolution on each axis (e.g.
960540 when the viewport size is 19201080). This improves performance
significantly when VoxelGI or SDFGI is enabled, at the cost of artifacts that
may be visible on polygon edges. The loss in quality becomes less noticeable
as the viewport resolution increases. LightmapGI rendering is not affected by
this setting. Equivalent to
ProjectSettings.rendering/global_illumination/gi/use_half_resolution.

void global_shader_parameter_add(name: StringName, type:
GlobalShaderParameterType, default_value: Variant)

Creates a new global shader uniform.

Note: Global shader parameter names are case-sensitive.

Variant global_shader_parameter_get(name: StringName) const

Returns the value of the global shader uniform specified by `name`.

Note: global_shader_parameter_get() has a large performance penalty as the
rendering thread needs to synchronize with the calling thread, which is slow.
Do not use this method during gameplay to avoid stuttering. If you need to
read values in a script after setting them, consider creating an autoload
where you store the values you need to query at the same time you're setting
them as global parameters.

Array[StringName] global_shader_parameter_get_list() const

Returns the list of global shader uniform names.

Note: global_shader_parameter_get() has a large performance penalty as the
rendering thread needs to synchronize with the calling thread, which is slow.
Do not use this method during gameplay to avoid stuttering. If you need to
read values in a script after setting them, consider creating an autoload
where you store the values you need to query at the same time you're setting
them as global parameters.

GlobalShaderParameterType global_shader_parameter_get_type(name: StringName)
const

Returns the type associated to the global shader uniform specified by `name`.

Note: global_shader_parameter_get() has a large performance penalty as the
rendering thread needs to synchronize with the calling thread, which is slow.
Do not use this method during gameplay to avoid stuttering. If you need to
read values in a script after setting them, consider creating an autoload
where you store the values you need to query at the same time you're setting
them as global parameters.

void global_shader_parameter_remove(name: StringName)

Removes the global shader uniform specified by `name`.

void global_shader_parameter_set(name: StringName, value: Variant)

Deprecated: This method has not been used since Godot 3.0.

This method does nothing and always returns `false`.

bool has_os_feature(feature: String) const

Returns `true` if the OS supports a certain `feature`. Features might be
`s3tc`, `etc`, and `etc2`.

void instance_attach_object_instance_id(instance: RID, id: int)

instance for proper culling with instances_cull_aabb(),
instances_cull_convex(), and instances_cull_ray().

void instance_attach_skeleton(instance: RID, skeleton: RID)

Attaches a skeleton to an instance. Removes the previous skeleton from the
instance.

RID instance_create()

Creates a visual instance and adds it to the RenderingServer. It can be
accessed with the RID that is returned. This RID will be used in all
`instance_*` RenderingServer functions.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingServer's free_rid() method.

An instance is a way of placing a 3D object in the scenario. Objects like
particles, meshes, reflection probes and decals need to be associated with an
instance to be visible in the scenario using instance_set_base().

Note: The equivalent node is VisualInstance3D.

RID instance_create2(base: RID, scenario: RID)

Creates a visual instance, adds it to the RenderingServer, and sets both base
and scenario. It can be accessed with the RID that is returned. This RID will
be used in all `instance_*` RenderingServer functions.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingServer's free_rid() method. This is a shorthand for using
instance_create() and setting the base and scenario manually.

Variant instance_geometry_get_shader_parameter(instance: RID, parameter:
StringName) const

shader uniform from the specified 3D geometry instance. The returned
dictionary is in PropertyInfo format, with the keys `name`, `class_name`,
`type`, `hint`, `hint_string` and `usage`. Equivalent to
GeometryInstance3D.get_instance_shader_parameter().

void instance_geometry_set_lightmap(instance: RID, lightmap: RID,
lightmap_uv_scale: Rect2, lightmap_slice: int)

Sets the lightmap GI instance to use for the specified 3D geometry instance.
The lightmap UV scale for the specified instance (equivalent to
GeometryInstance3D.gi_lightmap_scale) and lightmap atlas slice must also be
specified.

void instance_geometry_set_lod_bias(instance: RID, lod_bias: float)

Sets the level of detail bias to use when rendering the specified 3D geometry
instance. Higher values result in higher detail from further away. Equivalent
to GeometryInstance3D.lod_bias.

void instance_geometry_set_material_overlay(instance: RID, material: RID)

Sets a material that will be rendered for all surfaces on top of active
materials for the mesh associated with this instance. Equivalent to
GeometryInstance3D.material_overlay.

Equivalent to GeometryInstance3D.set_instance_shader_parameter().

void instance_geometry_set_transparency(instance: RID, transparency: float)

Sets the transparency for the given geometry instance. Equivalent to
GeometryInstance3D.transparency.

A transparency of `0.0` is fully opaque, while `1.0` is fully transparent.
Values greater than `0.0` (exclusive) will force the geometry's materials to
go through the transparent pipeline, which is slower to render and can exhibit
rendering issues due to incorrect transparency sorting. However, unlike using
a transparent material, setting `transparency` to a value greater than `0.0`
(exclusive) will not disable shadow rendering.

In spatial shaders, `1.0 - transparency` is set as the default value of the
`ALPHA` built-in.

Note: `transparency` is clamped between `0.0` and `1.0`, so this property
cannot be used to make transparent materials more opaque than they originally
are.

void instance_geometry_set_visibility_range(instance: RID, min: float, max:
float, min_margin: float, max_margin: float, fade_mode:
VisibilityRangeFadeMode)

Sets the visibility range values for the given geometry instance. Equivalent
to GeometryInstance3D.visibility_range_begin and related properties.

void instance_reset_physics_interpolation(instance: RID)

Prevents physics interpolation for the current physics tick.

This is useful when moving an instance to a new location, to give an
instantaneous change rather than interpolation from the previous location.

void instance_set_base(instance: RID, base: RID)

Sets the base of the instance. A base can be any of the 3D objects that are
created in the RenderingServer that can be displayed. For example, any of the
light types, mesh, multimesh, particle system, reflection probe, decal,
lightmap, voxel GI and visibility notifiers are all types that can be set as
the base of an instance in order to be displayed in the scenario.

void instance_set_blend_shape_weight(instance: RID, shape: int, weight: float)

Sets the weight for a given blend shape associated with this instance.

void instance_set_custom_aabb(instance: RID, aabb: AABB)

Sets a custom AABB to use when culling objects from the view frustum.
Equivalent to setting GeometryInstance3D.custom_aabb.

void instance_set_extra_visibility_margin(instance: RID, margin: float)

Sets a margin to increase the size of the AABB when culling objects from the
view frustum. This allows you to avoid culling objects that fall outside the
view frustum. Equivalent to GeometryInstance3D.extra_cull_margin.

void instance_set_ignore_culling(instance: RID, enabled: bool)

If `true`, ignores both frustum and occlusion culling on the specified 3D
geometry instance. This is not the same as
GeometryInstance3D.ignore_occlusion_culling, which only ignores occlusion
culling and leaves frustum culling intact.

void instance_set_interpolated(instance: RID, interpolated: bool)

Turns on and off physics interpolation for the instance.

void instance_set_layer_mask(instance: RID, mask: int)

Sets the render layers that this instance will be drawn to. Equivalent to
VisualInstance3D.layers.

void instance_set_pivot_data(instance: RID, sorting_offset: float,
use_aabb_center: bool)

Sets the visibility parent for the given instance. Equivalent to
Node3D.visibility_parent.

void instance_set_visible(instance: RID, visible: bool)

Sets whether an instance is drawn or not. Equivalent to Node3D.visible.

PackedInt64Array instances_cull_aabb(aabb: AABB, scenario: RID = RID()) const

Returns an array of object IDs intersecting with the provided AABB. Only 3D
nodes that inherit from VisualInstance3D are considered, such as
MeshInstance3D or DirectionalLight3D. Use @GlobalScope.instance_from_id() to
obtain the actual nodes. A scenario RID must be provided, which is available
in the World3D you want to query. This forces an update for all resources
queued to update.

selected layers. Equivalent to Light3D.light_cull_mask.

void light_set_distance_fade(decal: RID, enabled: bool, begin: float, shadow:
float, length: float)

Sets the distance fade for this 3D light. This acts as a form of level of
detail (LOD) and can be used to improve performance. Equivalent to
Light3D.distance_fade_enabled, Light3D.distance_fade_begin,
Light3D.distance_fade_shadow, and Light3D.distance_fade_length.

void light_set_max_sdfgi_cascade(light: RID, cascade: int)

RenderingServer. It can be accessed with the RID that is returned. This RID
will be used in all `lightmap_*` RenderingServer functions.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingServer's free_rid() method.

RID multimesh_create()

Creates a new multimesh on the RenderingServer and returns an RID handle. This
RID will be used in all `multimesh_*` RenderingServer functions.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingServer's free_rid() method.

To place in a scene, attach this multimesh to an instance using
instance_set_base() using the returned RID.

Note: The equivalent resource is MultiMesh.

Returns the MultiMesh data (such as instance transforms, colors, etc.). See
multimesh_set_buffer() for details on the returned data.

Note: If the buffer is in the engine's internal cache, it will have to be

multimesh_get_buffer() is potentially a slow operation and should be avoided
whenever possible.

RID multimesh_get_buffer_rd_rid(multimesh: RID) const

Returns the RenderingDevice RID handle of the MultiMesh, which can be used as
any other buffer on the Rendering Device.

RID multimesh_get_command_buffer_rd_rid(multimesh: RID) const

Returns the RenderingDevice RID handle of the MultiMesh command buffer. This
RID is only valid if `use_indirect` is set to `true` when allocating data
through multimesh_allocate_data(). It can be used to directly modify the
instance count via buffer.

The data structure is dependent on both how many surfaces the mesh contains
and whether it is indexed or not, the buffer has 5 integers in it, with the
last unused if the mesh is not indexed.

Each of the values in the buffer correspond to these options:

    
    
    Indexed:
      0 - indexCount;
      1 - instanceCount;
      2 - firstIndex;
      3 - vertexOffset;
      4 - firstInstance;
    Non Indexed:
      0 - vertexCount;
      1 - instanceCount;
      2 - firstVertex;

void multimesh_set_buffer(multimesh: RID, buffer: PackedFloat32Array)

Set the entire data to use for drawing the `multimesh` at once to `buffer`
(such as instance transforms and colors). `buffer`'s size must match the
number of instances multiplied by the per-instance data size (which depends on
the enabled MultiMesh fields). Otherwise, an error message is printed and
nothing is rendered. See also multimesh_get_buffer().

The per-instance data size and expected data order is:

    
    
    2D:
      - Position: 8 floats (8 floats for Transform2D)
      - Position + Vertex color: 12 floats (8 floats for Transform2D, 4 floats for Color)
      - Position + Custom data: 12 floats (8 floats for Transform2D, 4 floats of custom data)
      - Position + Vertex color + Custom data: 16 floats (8 floats for Transform2D, 4 floats for Color, 4 floats of custom data)
    3D:
      - Position: 12 floats (12 floats for Transform3D)
      - Position + Vertex color: 16 floats (12 floats for Transform3D, 4 floats for Color)
      - Position + Custom data: 16 floats (12 floats for Transform3D, 4 floats of custom data)
      - Position + Vertex color + Custom data: 20 floats (12 floats for Transform3D, 4 floats for Color, 4 floats of custom data)
    

Instance transforms are in row-major order. Specifically:

  * For Transform2D the float-order is: `(x.x, y.x, padding_float, origin.x, x.y, y.y, padding_float, origin.y)`.

  * For Transform3D the float-order is: `(basis.x.x, basis.y.x, basis.z.x, origin.x, basis.x.y, basis.y.y, basis.z.y, origin.y, basis.x.z, basis.y.z, basis.z.z, origin.z)`.

Variant shader_get_parameter_default(shader: RID, name: StringName) const

Returns the default value for the specified shader uniform. This is usually
the value written in the shader source code.

void shader_set_code(shader: RID, code: String)

Sets the shader's source code (which triggers recompilation after being
changed).

void shader_set_default_texture_parameter(shader: RID, name: StringName,
texture: RID, index: int = 0)

Sets a shader's default texture. Overwrites the texture given by name.

Note: If the sampler array is used use `index` to access the specified
texture.

void shader_set_path_hint(shader: RID, path: String)

Sets the path hint for the specified shader. This should generally match the
Shader resource's Resource.resource_path.

Returns the Transform3D set for a specific bone of this skeleton.

Transform2D skeleton_bone_get_transform_2d(skeleton: RID, bone: int) const

Returns the Transform2D set for a specific bone of this skeleton.

void skeleton_bone_set_transform(skeleton: RID, bone: int, transform:
Transform3D)

Sets the Transform3D for a specific bone of this skeleton.

void skeleton_bone_set_transform_2d(skeleton: RID, bone: int, transform:
Transform2D)

Sets the Transform2D for a specific bone of this skeleton.

RID skeleton_create()

Creates a skeleton and adds it to the RenderingServer. It can be accessed with
the RID that is returned. This RID will be used in all `skeleton_*`
RenderingServer functions.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingServer's free_rid() method.

int skeleton_get_bone_count(skeleton: RID) const

Returns the number of bones allocated for this skeleton.

Image sky_bake_panorama(sky: RID, energy: float, bake_irradiance: bool, size:
Vector2i)

Generates and returns an Image containing the radiance map for the specified
`sky` RID. This supports built-in sky material and custom sky shaders. If
`bake_irradiance` is `true`, the irradiance map is saved instead of the
radiance map. The radiance map is used to render reflected light, while the
irradiance map is used to render ambient light. See also
environment_bake_panorama().

Note: The image is saved in linear color space without any tonemapping
performed, which means it will look too dark if viewed directly in an image
editor. `energy` values above `1.0` can be used to brighten the resulting
image.

Note: `size` should be a 2:1 aspect ratio for the generated panorama to have
square pixels. For radiance maps, there is no point in using a height greater
than Sky.radiance_size, as it won't increase detail. Irradiance maps only
contain low-frequency data, so there is usually no point in going past a size
of 12864 pixels when saving an irradiance map.

RID sky_create()

Creates an empty sky and adds it to the RenderingServer. It can be accessed
with the RID that is returned. This RID will be used in all `sky_*`
RenderingServer functions.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingServer's free_rid() method.

void sky_set_material(sky: RID, material: RID)

Sets the material that the sky uses to render the background, ambient and
reflection maps.

void sky_set_mode(sky: RID, mode: SkyMode)

Sets the process `mode` of the sky specified by the `sky` RID. Equivalent to
Sky.process_mode.

void sky_set_radiance_size(sky: RID, radiance_size: int)

Sets the `radiance_size` of the sky specified by the `sky` RID (in pixels).
Equivalent to Sky.radiance_size.

RID spot_light_create()

Creates a spot light and adds it to the RenderingServer. It can be accessed
with the RID that is returned. This RID can be used in most `light_*`
RenderingServer functions.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingServer's free_rid() method.

To place in a scene, attach this spot light to an instance using
instance_set_base() using the returned RID.

void sub_surface_scattering_set_quality(quality: SubSurfaceScatteringQuality)

Sets
ProjectSettings.rendering/environment/subsurface_scattering/subsurface_scattering_quality
to use when rendering materials that have subsurface scattering enabled.

void sub_surface_scattering_set_scale(scale: float, depth_scale: float)

Sets the
ProjectSettings.rendering/environment/subsurface_scattering/subsurface_scattering_scale
and
ProjectSettings.rendering/environment/subsurface_scattering/subsurface_scattering_depth_scale
to use when rendering materials that have subsurface scattering enabled.

RID texture_2d_create(image: Image)

Creates a 2-dimensional texture and adds it to the RenderingServer. It can be
accessed with the RID that is returned. This RID will be used in all
`texture_2d_*` RenderingServer functions.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingServer's free_rid() method.

Note: The equivalent resource is Texture2D.

Note: Not to be confused with RenderingDevice.texture_create(), which creates
the graphics API's own texture type as opposed to the Godot-specific Texture2D
resource.

Image texture_2d_get(texture: RID) const

Returns an Image instance from the given `texture` RID.

Example: Get the test texture from get_test_texture() and apply it to a
Sprite2D node:

    
    
    var texture_rid = RenderingServer.get_test_texture()
    var texture = ImageTexture.create_from_image(RenderingServer.texture_2d_get(texture_rid))
    $Sprite2D.texture = texture
    

Image texture_2d_layer_get(texture: RID, layer: int) const

Returns an Image instance from the given `texture` RID and `layer`.

RID texture_2d_layered_create(layers: Array[Image], layered_type:
TextureLayeredType)

Creates a 2-dimensional layered texture and adds it to the RenderingServer. It
can be accessed with the RID that is returned. This RID will be used in all
`texture_2d_layered_*` RenderingServer functions.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingServer's free_rid() method.

Note: The equivalent resource is TextureLayered.

RID texture_2d_layered_placeholder_create(layered_type: TextureLayeredType)

Creates a placeholder for a 2-dimensional layered texture and adds it to the
RenderingServer. It can be accessed with the RID that is returned. This RID
will be used in all `texture_2d_layered_*` RenderingServer functions, although
it does nothing when used. See also texture_2d_placeholder_create().

Note: The equivalent resource is PlaceholderTextureLayered.

RID texture_2d_placeholder_create()

Creates a placeholder for a 2-dimensional layered texture and adds it to the
RenderingServer. It can be accessed with the RID that is returned. This RID
will be used in all `texture_2d_layered_*` RenderingServer functions, although
it does nothing when used. See also texture_2d_layered_placeholder_create().

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingServer's free_rid() method.

Note: The equivalent resource is PlaceholderTexture2D.

void texture_2d_update(texture: RID, image: Image, layer: int)

Updates the texture specified by the `texture` RID with the data in `image`. A
`layer` must also be specified, which should be `0` when updating a single-
layer texture (Texture2D).

Note: The `image` must have the same width, height and format as the current
`texture` data. Otherwise, an error will be printed and the original texture
won't be modified. If you need to use different width, height or format, use
texture_replace() instead.

RID texture_3d_create(format: Format, width: int, height: int, depth: int,
mipmaps: bool, data: Array[Image])

Note: The equivalent resource is Texture3D.

Array[Image] texture_3d_get(texture: RID) const

Returns 3D texture data as an array of Images for the specified texture RID.

RID texture_3d_placeholder_create()

Creates a placeholder for a 3-dimensional texture and adds it to the
RenderingServer. It can be accessed with the RID that is returned. This RID
will be used in all `texture_3d_*` RenderingServer functions, although it does
nothing when used.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingServer's free_rid() method.

Note: The equivalent resource is PlaceholderTexture3D.

void texture_3d_update(texture: RID, data: Array[Image])

Updates the texture specified by the `texture` RID's data with the data in
`data`. All the texture's layers must be replaced at once.

Note: The `texture` must have the same width, height, depth and format as the
current texture data. Otherwise, an error will be printed and the original
texture won't be modified. If you need to use different width, height, depth
or format, use texture_replace() instead.

RID texture_create_from_native_handle(type: TextureType, format: Format,
native_handle: int, width: int, height: int, depth: int, layers: int = 1,
layered_type: TextureLayeredType = 0)

Creates a texture based on a native handle that was created outside of Godot's
renderer.

Note: If using only the rendering device renderer, it's recommend to use
RenderingDevice.texture_create_from_extension() together with
texture_rd_create(), rather than this method. It will give you much more
control over the texture's format and usage.

Format texture_get_format(texture: RID) const

Returns the format for the texture.

int texture_get_native_handle(texture: RID, srgb: bool = false) const

Returns the internal graphics handle for this texture object. For use when
communicating with third-party APIs mostly with GDExtension.

Note: This function returns a `uint64_t` which internally maps to a `GLuint`
(OpenGL) or `VkImage` (Vulkan).

String texture_get_path(texture: RID) const

RID texture_get_rd_texture(texture: RID, srgb: bool = false) const

Returns a texture RID that can be used with RenderingDevice.

RID texture_proxy_create(base: RID)

Deprecated: ProxyTexture was removed in Godot 4.

This method does nothing and always returns an invalid RID.

void texture_proxy_update(texture: RID, proxy_to: RID)

Deprecated: ProxyTexture was removed in Godot 4.

This method does nothing.

RID texture_rd_create(rd_texture: RID, layer_type: TextureLayeredType = 0)

Creates a new texture object based on a texture created directly on the
RenderingDevice. If the texture contains layers, `layer_type` is used to
define the layer type.

void texture_replace(texture: RID, by_texture: RID)

Replaces `texture`'s texture data by the texture specified by the `by_texture`
RID, without changing `texture`'s RID.

void viewport_attach_camera(viewport: RID, camera: RID)

Sets a viewport's camera.

void viewport_attach_canvas(viewport: RID, canvas: RID)

Sets a viewport's canvas.

void viewport_attach_to_screen(viewport: RID, rect: Rect2 = Rect2(0, 0, 0, 0),
screen: int = 0)

Copies the viewport to a region of the screen specified by `rect`. If
viewport_set_render_direct_to_screen() is `true`, then the viewport does not
use a framebuffer and the contents of the viewport are rendered directly to
screen. However, note that the root viewport is drawn last, therefore it will
draw over the screen. Accordingly, you must set the root viewport to an area
that does not cover the area that you have attached this viewport to.

For example, you can set the root viewport to not render at all with the
following code:

GDScript

    
    
    func _ready():
        RenderingServer.viewport_attach_to_screen(get_viewport().get_viewport_rid(), Rect2())
        RenderingServer.viewport_attach_to_screen($Viewport.get_viewport_rid(), Rect2(0, 0, 600, 600))
    

Using this can result in significant optimization, especially on lower-end
devices. However, it comes at the cost of having to manage your viewports
manually. For further optimization, see
viewport_set_render_direct_to_screen().

RID viewport_create()

Creates an empty viewport and adds it to the RenderingServer. It can be
accessed with the RID that is returned. This RID will be used in all
`viewport_*` RenderingServer functions.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingServer's free_rid() method.

Note: The equivalent node is Viewport.

float viewport_get_measured_render_time_cpu(viewport: RID) const

Returns the CPU time taken to render the last frame in milliseconds. This only
includes time spent in rendering-related operations; scripts' `_process`
functions and other engine subsystems are not included in this readout. To get
a complete readout of CPU time spent to render the scene, sum the render times
of all viewports that are drawn every frame plus get_frame_setup_time_cpu().
Unlike Engine.get_frames_per_second(), this method will accurately reflect CPU
utilization even if framerate is capped via V-Sync or Engine.max_fps. See also
viewport_get_measured_render_time_gpu().

Note: Requires measurements to be enabled on the specified `viewport` using
viewport_set_measure_render_time(). Otherwise, this method returns `0.0`.

float viewport_get_measured_render_time_gpu(viewport: RID) const

Returns the GPU time taken to render the last frame in milliseconds. To get a
complete readout of GPU time spent to render the scene, sum the render times
of all viewports that are drawn every frame. Unlike
Engine.get_frames_per_second(), this method accurately reflects GPU
utilization even if framerate is capped via V-Sync or Engine.max_fps. See also
viewport_get_measured_render_time_cpu().

Note: Requires measurements to be enabled on the specified `viewport` using
viewport_set_measure_render_time(). Otherwise, this method returns `0.0`.

Note: When GPU utilization is low enough during a certain period of time, GPUs
will decrease their power state (which in turn decreases core and memory clock
speeds). This can cause the reported GPU time to increase if GPU utilization
is kept low enough by a framerate cap (compared to what it would be at the
GPU's highest power state). Keep this in mind when benchmarking using
viewport_get_measured_render_time_gpu(). This behavior can be overridden in
the graphics driver settings at the cost of higher power usage.

int viewport_get_render_info(viewport: RID, type: ViewportRenderInfoType,
info: ViewportRenderInfo)

Returns a statistic about the rendering engine which can be used for
performance profiling. This is separated into render pass `type`s, each of
them having the same `info`s you can query (different passes will return
different values). See ViewportRenderInfoType for a list of render pass types
and ViewportRenderInfo for a list of information that can be queried.

See also get_rendering_info(), which returns global information across all
viewports.

Note: Viewport rendering information is not available until at least 2 frames
have been rendered by the engine. If rendering information is not available,
viewport_get_render_info() returns `0`. To print rendering information in
`_ready()` successfully, use the following:

    
    
    func _ready():
        for _i in 2:
            await get_tree().process_frame
    
        print(
                RenderingServer.viewport_get_render_info(get_viewport().get_viewport_rid(),
                RenderingServer.VIEWPORT_RENDER_INFO_TYPE_VISIBLE,
                RenderingServer.VIEWPORT_RENDER_INFO_DRAW_CALLS_IN_FRAME)
        )
    

RID viewport_get_render_target(viewport: RID) const

Returns the render target for the viewport.

RID viewport_get_texture(viewport: RID) const

Returns the viewport's last rendered frame.

ViewportUpdateMode viewport_get_update_mode(viewport: RID) const

Returns the viewport's update mode. See ViewportUpdateMode constants for
options.

Warning: Calling this from any thread other than the rendering thread will be
detrimental to performance.

void viewport_remove_canvas(viewport: RID, canvas: RID)

Detaches a viewport from a canvas.

void viewport_set_active(viewport: RID, active: bool)

If `true`, sets the viewport active, else sets it inactive.

void viewport_set_anisotropic_filtering_level(viewport: RID,
anisotropic_filtering_level: ViewportAnisotropicFiltering)

Sets the maximum number of samples to take when using anisotropic filtering on
textures (as a power of two). A higher sample count will result in sharper
textures at oblique angles, but is more expensive to compute. A value of `0`
forcibly disables anisotropic filtering, even on materials where it is
enabled.

The anisotropic filtering level also affects decals and light projectors if
they are configured to use anisotropic filtering. See
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/decals/filter and
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/light_projectors/filter.

Note: In 3D, for this setting to have an effect, set
BaseMaterial3D.texture_filter to
BaseMaterial3D.TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC or
BaseMaterial3D.TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC on materials.

Note: In 2D, for this setting to have an effect, set CanvasItem.texture_filter
to CanvasItem.TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC or
CanvasItem.TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC on the CanvasItem
node displaying the texture (or in CanvasTexture). However, anisotropic
filtering is rarely useful in 2D, so only enable it for textures in 2D if it
makes a meaningful visual difference.

void viewport_set_canvas_cull_mask(viewport: RID, canvas_cull_mask: int)

Sets the rendering mask associated with this Viewport. Only CanvasItem nodes
with a matching rendering visibility layer will be rendered by this Viewport.

void viewport_set_canvas_stacking(viewport: RID, canvas: RID, layer: int,
sublayer: int)

Sets the stacking order for a viewport's canvas.

`layer` is the actual canvas layer, while `sublayer` specifies the stacking
order of the canvas among those in the same layer.

void viewport_set_canvas_transform(viewport: RID, canvas: RID, offset:
Transform2D)

Sets the transformation of a viewport's canvas.

void viewport_set_clear_mode(viewport: RID, clear_mode: ViewportClearMode)

Sets the clear mode of a viewport. See ViewportClearMode for options.

void viewport_set_debug_draw(viewport: RID, draw: ViewportDebugDraw)

Sets the debug draw mode of a viewport. See ViewportDebugDraw for options.

void viewport_set_default_canvas_item_texture_filter(viewport: RID, filter:
CanvasItemTextureFilter)

Sets the default texture filtering mode for the specified `viewport` RID. See
CanvasItemTextureFilter for options.

void viewport_set_default_canvas_item_texture_repeat(viewport: RID, repeat:
CanvasItemTextureRepeat)

Sets the default texture repeat mode for the specified `viewport` RID. See
CanvasItemTextureRepeat for options.

void viewport_set_disable_2d(viewport: RID, disable: bool)

If `true`, the viewport's canvas (i.e. 2D and GUI elements) is not rendered.

void viewport_set_disable_3d(viewport: RID, disable: bool)

If `true`, the viewport's 3D elements are not rendered.

void viewport_set_environment_mode(viewport: RID, mode:
ViewportEnvironmentMode)

Sets the viewport's environment mode which allows enabling or disabling
rendering of 3D environment over 2D canvas. When disabled, 2D will not be
affected by the environment. When enabled, 2D will be affected by the
environment if the environment background mode is ENV_BG_CANVAS. The default
behavior is to inherit the setting from the viewport's parent. If the topmost
parent is also set to VIEWPORT_ENVIRONMENT_INHERIT, then the behavior will be
the same as if it was set to VIEWPORT_ENVIRONMENT_ENABLED.

void viewport_set_fsr_sharpness(viewport: RID, sharpness: float)

Determines how sharp the upscaled image will be when using the FSR upscaling
mode. Sharpness halves with every whole number. Values go from 0.0 (sharpest)
to 2.0. Values above 2.0 won't make a visible difference.

void viewport_set_global_canvas_transform(viewport: RID, transform:
Transform2D)

Sets the viewport's global transformation matrix.

void viewport_set_measure_render_time(viewport: RID, enable: bool)

Sets the measurement for the given `viewport` RID (obtained using
Viewport.get_viewport_rid()). Once enabled,
viewport_get_measured_render_time_cpu() and
viewport_get_measured_render_time_gpu() will return values greater than `0.0`
when queried with the given `viewport`.

void viewport_set_msaa_2d(viewport: RID, msaa: ViewportMSAA)

Sets the multisample antialiasing mode for 2D/Canvas on the specified
`viewport` RID. See ViewportMSAA for options. Equivalent to
ProjectSettings.rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/msaa_2d or Viewport.msaa_2d.

void viewport_set_msaa_3d(viewport: RID, msaa: ViewportMSAA)

Sets the multisample antialiasing mode for 3D on the specified `viewport` RID.
See ViewportMSAA for options. Equivalent to
ProjectSettings.rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/msaa_3d or Viewport.msaa_3d.

void viewport_set_occlusion_culling_build_quality(quality:
ViewportOcclusionCullingBuildQuality)

Sets the ProjectSettings.rendering/occlusion_culling/bvh_build_quality to use
for occlusion culling. This parameter is global and cannot be set on a per-
viewport basis.

void viewport_set_occlusion_rays_per_thread(rays_per_thread: int)

Sets the ProjectSettings.rendering/occlusion_culling/occlusion_rays_per_thread
to use for occlusion culling. This parameter is global and cannot be set on a
per-viewport basis.

void viewport_set_parent_viewport(viewport: RID, parent_viewport: RID)

Sets the viewport's parent to the viewport specified by the `parent_viewport`
RID.

void viewport_set_positional_shadow_atlas_quadrant_subdivision(viewport: RID,
quadrant: int, subdivision: int)

Sets the number of subdivisions to use in the specified shadow atlas
`quadrant` for omni and spot shadows. See also
Viewport.set_positional_shadow_atlas_quadrant_subdiv().

void viewport_set_positional_shadow_atlas_size(viewport: RID, size: int,
use_16_bits: bool = false)

Sets the `size` of the shadow atlas's images (used for omni and spot lights)
on the viewport specified by the `viewport` RID. The value is rounded up to
the nearest power of 2. If `use_16_bits` is `true`, use 16 bits for the
omni/spot shadow depth map. Enabling this results in shadows having less
precision and may result in shadow acne, but can lead to performance
improvements on some devices.

Note: If this is set to `0`, no positional shadows will be visible at all.
This can improve performance significantly on low-end systems by reducing both
the CPU and GPU load (as fewer draw calls are needed to draw the scene without
shadows).

void viewport_set_render_direct_to_screen(viewport: RID, enabled: bool)

If `true`, render the contents of the viewport directly to screen. This allows
a low-level optimization where you can skip drawing a viewport to the root
viewport. While this optimization can result in a significant increase in
speed (especially on older devices), it comes at a cost of usability. When
this is enabled, you cannot read from the viewport or from the screen_texture.
You also lose the benefit of certain window settings, such as the various
stretch modes. Another consequence to be aware of is that in 2D the rendering
happens in window coordinates, so if you have a viewport that is double the
size of the window, and you set this, then only the portion that fits within
the window will be drawn, no automatic scaling is possible, even if your game
scene is significantly larger than the window size.

void viewport_set_scaling_3d_mode(viewport: RID, scaling_3d_mode:
ViewportScaling3DMode)

Sets the 3D resolution scaling mode. Bilinear scaling renders at different
resolution to either undersample or supersample the viewport. FidelityFX Super
Resolution 1.0, abbreviated to FSR, is an upscaling technology that produces
high quality images at fast framerates by using a spatially aware upscaling
algorithm. FSR is slightly more expensive than bilinear, but it produces
significantly higher image quality. FSR should be used where possible.

void viewport_set_scaling_3d_scale(viewport: RID, scale: float)

Scales the 3D render buffer based on the viewport size uses an image filter
specified in ViewportScaling3DMode to scale the output image to the full
viewport size. Values lower than `1.0` can be used to speed up 3D rendering at
the cost of quality (undersampling). Values greater than `1.0` are only valid
for bilinear mode and can be used to improve 3D rendering quality at a high
performance cost (supersampling). See also ViewportMSAA for multi-sample
antialiasing, which is significantly cheaper but only smoothens the edges of
polygons.

When using FSR upscaling, AMD recommends exposing the following values as
preset options to users "Ultra Quality: 0.77", "Quality: 0.67", "Balanced:
0.59", "Performance: 0.5" instead of exposing the entire scale.

void viewport_set_scenario(viewport: RID, scenario: RID)

Sets a viewport's scenario. The scenario contains information about
environment information, reflection atlas, etc.

void viewport_set_screen_space_aa(viewport: RID, mode: ViewportScreenSpaceAA)

Sets the viewport's screen-space antialiasing mode. Equivalent to
ProjectSettings.rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/screen_space_aa or
Viewport.screen_space_aa.

void viewport_set_sdf_oversize_and_scale(viewport: RID, oversize:
ViewportSDFOversize, scale: ViewportSDFScale)

Sets the viewport's 2D signed distance field
ProjectSettings.rendering/2d/sdf/oversize and
ProjectSettings.rendering/2d/sdf/scale. This is used when sampling the signed
distance field in CanvasItem shaders as well as GPUParticles2D collision. This
is not used by SDFGI in 3D rendering.

void viewport_set_size(viewport: RID, width: int, height: int)

Sets the viewport's width and height in pixels.

void viewport_set_snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel(viewport: RID, enabled: bool)

If `true`, canvas item transforms (i.e. origin position) are snapped to the
nearest pixel when rendering. This can lead to a crisper appearance at the
cost of less smooth movement, especially when Camera2D smoothing is enabled.
Equivalent to ProjectSettings.rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel.

void viewport_set_snap_2d_vertices_to_pixel(viewport: RID, enabled: bool)

If `true`, canvas item vertices (i.e. polygon points) are snapped to the
nearest pixel when rendering. This can lead to a crisper appearance at the
cost of less smooth movement, especially when Camera2D smoothing is enabled.
Equivalent to ProjectSettings.rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_vertices_to_pixel.

void viewport_set_texture_mipmap_bias(viewport: RID, mipmap_bias: float)

Affects the final texture sharpness by reading from a lower or higher mipmap
(also called "texture LOD bias"). Negative values make mipmapped textures
sharper but grainier when viewed at a distance, while positive values make
mipmapped textures blurrier (even when up close). To get sharper textures at a
distance without introducing too much graininess, set this between `-0.75` and
`0.0`. Enabling temporal antialiasing
(ProjectSettings.rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/use_taa) can help reduce the
graininess visible when using negative mipmap bias.

Note: When the 3D scaling mode is set to FSR 1.0, this value is used to adjust
the automatic mipmap bias which is calculated internally based on the scale
factor. The formula for this is `-log2(1.0 / scale) + mipmap_bias`.

void viewport_set_transparent_background(viewport: RID, enabled: bool)

If `true`, the viewport renders its background as transparent.

void viewport_set_update_mode(viewport: RID, update_mode: ViewportUpdateMode)

Sets when the viewport should be updated. See ViewportUpdateMode constants for
options.

void viewport_set_use_debanding(viewport: RID, enable: bool)

If `true`, enables debanding on the specified viewport. Equivalent to
ProjectSettings.rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/use_debanding or
Viewport.use_debanding.

void viewport_set_use_hdr_2d(viewport: RID, enabled: bool)

If `true`, 2D rendering will use a high dynamic range (HDR) format framebuffer
matching the bit depth of the 3D framebuffer. When using the Forward+ renderer
this will be an `RGBA16` framebuffer, while when using the Mobile renderer it
will be an `RGB10_A2` framebuffer. Additionally, 2D rendering will take place
in linear color space and will be converted to sRGB space immediately before
blitting to the screen (if the Viewport is attached to the screen).
Practically speaking, this means that the end result of the Viewport will not
be clamped into the `0-1` range and can be used in 3D rendering without color
space adjustments. This allows 2D rendering to take advantage of effects
requiring high dynamic range (e.g. 2D glow) as well as substantially improves
the appearance of effects requiring highly detailed gradients. This setting
has the same effect as Viewport.use_hdr_2d.

Note: This setting will have no effect when using the Compatibility renderer,
which always renders in low dynamic range for performance reasons.

void viewport_set_use_occlusion_culling(viewport: RID, enable: bool)

If `true`, enables occlusion culling on the specified viewport. Equivalent to
ProjectSettings.rendering/occlusion_culling/use_occlusion_culling.

void viewport_set_use_taa(viewport: RID, enable: bool)

If `true`, use temporal antialiasing. Equivalent to
ProjectSettings.rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/use_taa or Viewport.use_taa.

void viewport_set_use_xr(viewport: RID, use_xr: bool)

If `true`, the viewport uses augmented or virtual reality technologies. See
XRInterface.

void viewport_set_vrs_mode(viewport: RID, mode: ViewportVRSMode)

Sets the Variable Rate Shading (VRS) mode for the viewport. If the GPU does
not support VRS, this property is ignored. Equivalent to
ProjectSettings.rendering/vrs/mode.

void viewport_set_vrs_texture(viewport: RID, texture: RID)

The texture to use when the VRS mode is set to VIEWPORT_VRS_TEXTURE.
Equivalent to ProjectSettings.rendering/vrs/texture.

void viewport_set_vrs_update_mode(viewport: RID, mode: ViewportVRSUpdateMode)

Sets the update mode for Variable Rate Shading (VRS) for the viewport. VRS
requires the input texture to be converted to the format usable by the VRS
method supported by the hardware. The update mode defines how often this
happens. If the GPU does not support VRS, or VRS is not enabled, this property
is ignored.

If set to VIEWPORT_VRS_UPDATE_ONCE, the input texture is copied once and the
mode is changed to VIEWPORT_VRS_UPDATE_DISABLED.

RID visibility_notifier_create()

Creates a new 3D visibility notifier object and adds it to the
RenderingServer. It can be accessed with the RID that is returned. This RID
will be used in all `visibility_notifier_*` RenderingServer functions.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingServer's free_rid() method.

To place in a scene, attach this notifier to an instance using
instance_set_base() using the returned RID.

Note: The equivalent node is VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D.

RID voxel_gi_create()

Creates a new voxel-based global illumination object and adds it to the
RenderingServer. It can be accessed with the RID that is returned. This RID
will be used in all `voxel_gi_*` RenderingServer functions.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingServer's free_rid() method.

Note: The equivalent node is VoxelGI.

void voxel_gi_set_baked_exposure_normalization(voxel_gi: RID, baked_exposure:
float)

Used to inform the renderer what exposure normalization value was used while
baking the voxel gi. This value will be used and modulated at run time to
ensure that the voxel gi maintains a consistent level of exposure even if the
scene-wide exposure normalization is changed at run time. For more information
see camera_attributes_set_exposure().

void voxel_gi_set_bias(voxel_gi: RID, bias: float)

Sets the VoxelGIData.bias value to use on the specified `voxel_gi`'s RID.

void voxel_gi_set_dynamic_range(voxel_gi: RID, range: float)

Sets the VoxelGIData.dynamic_range value to use on the specified `voxel_gi`'s
RID.

void voxel_gi_set_energy(voxel_gi: RID, energy: float)

Sets the VoxelGIData.energy value to use on the specified `voxel_gi`'s RID.

void voxel_gi_set_interior(voxel_gi: RID, enable: bool)

Sets the VoxelGIData.interior value to use on the specified `voxel_gi`'s RID.

void voxel_gi_set_normal_bias(voxel_gi: RID, bias: float)

Sets the VoxelGIData.normal_bias value to use on the specified `voxel_gi`'s
RID.

void voxel_gi_set_propagation(voxel_gi: RID, amount: float)

Sets the VoxelGIData.propagation value to use on the specified `voxel_gi`'s
RID.

void voxel_gi_set_quality(quality: VoxelGIQuality)

Sets the ProjectSettings.rendering/global_illumination/voxel_gi/quality value
to use when rendering. This parameter is global and cannot be set on a per-
VoxelGI basis.

void voxel_gi_set_use_two_bounces(voxel_gi: RID, enable: bool)

Sets the VoxelGIData.use_two_bounces value to use on the specified
`voxel_gi`'s RID.
