# GLTFObjectModelProperty

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Describes how to access a property as defined in the glTF object model.

## Description

GLTFObjectModelProperty defines a mapping between a property in the glTF
object model and a NodePath in the Godot scene tree. This can be used to
animate properties in a glTF file using the `KHR_animation_pointer` extension,
or to access them through an engine-agnostic script such as a behavior graph
as defined by the `KHR_interactivity` extension.

The glTF property is identified by JSON pointer(s) stored in json_pointers,
while the Godot property it maps to is defined by node_paths. In most cases
json_pointers and node_paths will each only have one item, but in some cases a
single glTF JSON pointer will map to multiple Godot properties, or a single
Godot property will be mapped to multiple glTF JSON pointers, or it might be a
many-to-many relationship.

Expression objects can be used to define conversions between the data, such as
when glTF defines an angle in radians and Godot uses degrees. The
object_model_type property defines the type of data stored in the glTF file as
defined by the object model, see GLTFObjectModelType for possible values.

## Enumerations

enum GLTFObjectModelType:

GLTFObjectModelType GLTF_OBJECT_MODEL_TYPE_UNKNOWN = `0`

Unknown or not set object model type. If the object model type is set to this
value, the real type still needs to be determined.

GLTFObjectModelType GLTF_OBJECT_MODEL_TYPE_BOOL = `1`

Object model type "bool". Represented in the glTF JSON as a boolean, and
encoded in a GLTFAccessor as "SCALAR". When encoded in an accessor, a value of
`0` is `false`, and any other value is `true`.

GLTFObjectModelType GLTF_OBJECT_MODEL_TYPE_FLOAT = `2`

Object model type "float". Represented in the glTF JSON as a number, and
encoded in a GLTFAccessor as "SCALAR".

GLTFObjectModelType GLTF_OBJECT_MODEL_TYPE_FLOAT_ARRAY = `3`

Object model type "float[]". Represented in the glTF JSON as an array of
numbers, and encoded in a GLTFAccessor as "SCALAR".

GLTFObjectModelType GLTF_OBJECT_MODEL_TYPE_FLOAT2 = `4`

Object model type "float2". Represented in the glTF JSON as an array of two
numbers, and encoded in a GLTFAccessor as "VEC2".

GLTFObjectModelType GLTF_OBJECT_MODEL_TYPE_FLOAT3 = `5`

Object model type "float3". Represented in the glTF JSON as an array of three
numbers, and encoded in a GLTFAccessor as "VEC3".

GLTFObjectModelType GLTF_OBJECT_MODEL_TYPE_FLOAT4 = `6`

Object model type "float4". Represented in the glTF JSON as an array of four
numbers, and encoded in a GLTFAccessor as "VEC4".

GLTFObjectModelType GLTF_OBJECT_MODEL_TYPE_FLOAT2X2 = `7`

Object model type "float2x2". Represented in the glTF JSON as an array of four
numbers, and encoded in a GLTFAccessor as "MAT2".

GLTFObjectModelType GLTF_OBJECT_MODEL_TYPE_FLOAT3X3 = `8`

Object model type "float3x3". Represented in the glTF JSON as an array of nine
numbers, and encoded in a GLTFAccessor as "MAT3".

GLTFObjectModelType GLTF_OBJECT_MODEL_TYPE_FLOAT4X4 = `9`

Object model type "float4x4". Represented in the glTF JSON as an array of
sixteen numbers, and encoded in a GLTFAccessor as "MAT4".

GLTFObjectModelType GLTF_OBJECT_MODEL_TYPE_INT = `10`

Object model type "int". Represented in the glTF JSON as a number, and encoded
in a GLTFAccessor as "SCALAR". The range of values is limited to signed
integers. For `KHR_interactivity`, only 32-bit integers are supported.

## Property Descriptions

Expression gltf_to_godot_expression

  * void set_gltf_to_godot_expression(value: Expression)

  * Expression get_gltf_to_godot_expression()

If set, this Expression will be used to convert the property value from the
glTF object model to the value expected by the Godot property. This is useful
when the glTF object model uses a different unit system, or when the data
needs to be transformed in some way. If `null`, the value will be copied as-
is.

Expression godot_to_gltf_expression

  * void set_godot_to_gltf_expression(value: Expression)

  * Expression get_godot_to_gltf_expression()

If set, this Expression will be used to convert the property value from the
Godot property to the value expected by the glTF object model. This is useful
when the glTF object model uses a different unit system, or when the data
needs to be transformed in some way. If `null`, the value will be copied as-
is.

Array[PackedStringArray] json_pointers = `[]`

  * void set_json_pointers(value: Array[PackedStringArray])

  * Array[PackedStringArray] get_json_pointers()

The glTF object model JSON pointers used to identify the property in the glTF
object model. In most cases, there will be only one item in this array, but
niche cases may require multiple pointers. The items are themselves arrays
which represent the JSON pointer split into its components.

Array[NodePath] node_paths = `[]`

  * void set_node_paths(value: Array[NodePath])

  * Array[NodePath] get_node_paths()

An array of NodePaths that point to a property, or multiple properties, in the
Godot scene tree. On import, this will either be set by GLTFDocument, or by a
GLTFDocumentExtension class. For simple cases, use append_path_to_property()
to add properties to this array.

In most cases node_paths will only have one item, but in some cases a single
glTF JSON pointer will map to multiple Godot properties. For example, a
GLTFCamera or GLTFLight used on multiple glTF nodes will be represented by
multiple Godot nodes.

GLTFObjectModelType object_model_type = `0`

  * void set_object_model_type(value: GLTFObjectModelType)

  * GLTFObjectModelType get_object_model_type()

The type of data stored in the glTF file as defined by the object model. This
is a superset of the available accessor types, and determines the accessor
type. See GLTFObjectModelType for possible values.

Variant.Type variant_type = `0`

  * void set_variant_type(value: Variant.Type)

  * Variant.Type get_variant_type()

The type of data stored in the Godot property. This is the type of the
property that the node_paths point to.

## Method Descriptions

void append_node_path(node_path: NodePath)

Appends a NodePath to node_paths. This can be used by GLTFDocumentExtension
classes to define how a glTF object model property maps to a Godot property,
or multiple Godot properties. Prefer using append_path_to_property() for
simple cases. Be sure to also call set_types() once (the order does not
matter).

void append_path_to_property(node_path: NodePath, prop_name: StringName)

High-level wrapper over append_node_path() that handles the most common cases.
It constructs a new NodePath using `node_path` as a base and appends
`prop_name` to the subpath. Be sure to also call set_types() once (the order
does not matter).

GLTFAccessorType get_accessor_type() const

The GLTF accessor type associated with this property's object_model_type. See
GLTFAccessor.accessor_type for possible values, and see GLTFObjectModelType
for how the object model type maps to accessor types.

bool has_json_pointers() const

Returns `true` if json_pointers is not empty. This is used during export to
determine if a GLTFObjectModelProperty can handle converting a Godot property
to a glTF object model property.

bool has_node_paths() const

Returns `true` if node_paths is not empty. This is used during import to
determine if a GLTFObjectModelProperty can handle converting a glTF object
model property to a Godot property.

void set_types(variant_type: Variant.Type, obj_model_type:
GLTFObjectModelType)

Sets the variant_type and object_model_type properties. This is a convenience
method to set both properties at once, since they are almost always known at
the same time. This method should be called once. Calling it again with the
same values will have no effect.
