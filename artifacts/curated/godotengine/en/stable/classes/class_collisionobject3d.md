# CollisionObject3D

Inherits: Node3D < Node < Object

Inherited By: Area3D, PhysicsBody3D

Abstract base class for 3D physics objects.

## Description

Abstract base class for 3D physics objects. CollisionObject3D can hold any
number of Shape3Ds for collision. Each shape must be assigned to a shape
owner. Shape owners are not nodes and do not appear in the editor, but are
accessible through code using the `shape_owner_*` methods.

Warning: With a non-uniform scale, this node will likely not behave as
expected. It is advised to keep its scale the same on all axes and adjust its
collision shape(s) instead.

## Signals

input_event(camera: Node, event: InputEvent, event_position: Vector3, normal:
Vector3, shape_idx: int)

Emitted when the object receives an unhandled InputEvent. `event_position` is
the location in world space of the mouse pointer on the surface of the shape
with index `shape_idx` and `normal` is the normal vector of the surface at
that point.

mouse_entered()

Emitted when the mouse pointer enters any of this object's shapes. Requires
input_ray_pickable to be `true` and at least one collision_layer bit to be
set.

Note: Due to the lack of continuous collision detection, this signal may not
be emitted in the expected order if the mouse moves fast enough and the
CollisionObject3D's area is small. This signal may also not be emitted if
another CollisionObject3D is overlapping the CollisionObject3D in question.

mouse_exited()

Emitted when the mouse pointer exits all this object's shapes. Requires
input_ray_pickable to be `true` and at least one collision_layer bit to be
set.

Note: Due to the lack of continuous collision detection, this signal may not
be emitted in the expected order if the mouse moves fast enough and the
CollisionObject3D's area is small. This signal may also not be emitted if
another CollisionObject3D is overlapping the CollisionObject3D in question.

## Enumerations

enum DisableMode:

DisableMode DISABLE_MODE_REMOVE = `0`

When Node.process_mode is set to Node.PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED, remove from the
physics simulation to stop all physics interactions with this
CollisionObject3D.

Automatically re-added to the physics simulation when the Node is processed
again.

DisableMode DISABLE_MODE_MAKE_STATIC = `1`

When Node.process_mode is set to Node.PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED, make the body
static. Doesn't affect Area3D. PhysicsBody3D can't be affected by forces or
other bodies while static.

Automatically set PhysicsBody3D back to its original mode when the Node is
processed again.

DisableMode DISABLE_MODE_KEEP_ACTIVE = `2`

When Node.process_mode is set to Node.PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED, do not affect the
physics simulation.

## Property Descriptions

int collision_layer = `1`

  * void set_collision_layer(value: int)

  * int get_collision_layer()

The physics layers this CollisionObject3D is in. Collision objects can exist
in one or more of 32 different layers. See also collision_mask.

Note: Object A can detect a contact with object B only if object B is in any
of the layers that object A scans. See Collision layers and masks in the
documentation for more information.

int collision_mask = `1`

  * void set_collision_mask(value: int)

  * int get_collision_mask()

The physics layers this CollisionObject3D scans. Collision objects can scan
one or more of 32 different layers. See also collision_layer.

Note: Object A can detect a contact with object B only if object B is in any
of the layers that object A scans. See Collision layers and masks in the
documentation for more information.

float collision_priority = `1.0`

  * void set_collision_priority(value: float)

  * float get_collision_priority()

The priority used to solve colliding when occurring penetration. The higher
the priority is, the lower the penetration into the object will be. This can
for example be used to prevent the player from breaking through the boundaries
of a level.

DisableMode disable_mode = `0`

  * void set_disable_mode(value: DisableMode)

  * DisableMode get_disable_mode()

Defines the behavior in physics when Node.process_mode is set to
Node.PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED. See DisableMode for more details about the
different modes.

bool input_capture_on_drag = `false`

  * void set_capture_input_on_drag(value: bool)

  * bool get_capture_input_on_drag()

If `true`, the CollisionObject3D will continue to receive input events as the
mouse is dragged across its shapes.

bool input_ray_pickable = `true`

  * void set_ray_pickable(value: bool)

  * bool is_ray_pickable()

If `true`, this object is pickable. A pickable object can detect the mouse
pointer entering/leaving, and if the mouse is inside it, report input events.
Requires at least one collision_layer bit to be set.

## Method Descriptions

void _input_event(camera: Camera3D, event: InputEvent, event_position:
Vector3, normal: Vector3, shape_idx: int) virtual

Receives unhandled InputEvents. `event_position` is the location in world
space of the mouse pointer on the surface of the shape with index `shape_idx`
and `normal` is the normal vector of the surface at that point. Connect to the
input_event signal to easily pick up these events.

Note: _input_event() requires input_ray_pickable to be `true` and at least one
collision_layer bit to be set.

void _mouse_enter() virtual

Called when the mouse pointer enters any of this object's shapes. Requires
input_ray_pickable to be `true` and at least one collision_layer bit to be
set. Note that moving between different shapes within a single
CollisionObject3D won't cause this function to be called.

void _mouse_exit() virtual

Called when the mouse pointer exits all this object's shapes. Requires
input_ray_pickable to be `true` and at least one collision_layer bit to be
set. Note that moving between different shapes within a single
CollisionObject3D won't cause this function to be called.

int create_shape_owner(owner: Object)

Creates a new shape owner for the given object. Returns `owner_id` of the new
owner for future reference.

bool get_collision_layer_value(layer_number: int) const

Returns whether or not the specified layer of the collision_layer is enabled,
given a `layer_number` between 1 and 32.

bool get_collision_mask_value(layer_number: int) const

Returns whether or not the specified layer of the collision_mask is enabled,
given a `layer_number` between 1 and 32.

RID get_rid() const

Returns the object's RID.

PackedInt32Array get_shape_owners()

Returns an Array of `owner_id` identifiers. You can use these ids in other
methods that take `owner_id` as an argument.

bool is_shape_owner_disabled(owner_id: int) const

If `true`, the shape owner and its shapes are disabled.

void remove_shape_owner(owner_id: int)

Removes the given shape owner.

void set_collision_layer_value(layer_number: int, value: bool)

Based on `value`, enables or disables the specified layer in the
collision_layer, given a `layer_number` between 1 and 32.

void set_collision_mask_value(layer_number: int, value: bool)

Based on `value`, enables or disables the specified layer in the
collision_mask, given a `layer_number` between 1 and 32.

int shape_find_owner(shape_index: int) const

Returns the `owner_id` of the given shape.

void shape_owner_add_shape(owner_id: int, shape: Shape3D)
