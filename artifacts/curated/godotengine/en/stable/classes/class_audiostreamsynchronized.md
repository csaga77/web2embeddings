# AudioStreamSynchronized

Inherits: AudioStream < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Stream that can be fitted with sub-streams, which will be played in-sync.

## Description

This is a stream that can be fitted with sub-streams, which will be played in-
sync. The streams begin at exactly the same time when play is pressed, and
will end when the last of them ends. If one of the sub-streams loops, then
playback will continue.

## Properties

int | stream_count | `0`  
---|---|---  
  
## Methods

AudioStream | get_sync_stream(stream_index: int) const  
---|---  
float | get_sync_stream_volume(stream_index: int) const  
void | set_sync_stream(stream_index: int, audio_stream: AudioStream)  
void | set_sync_stream_volume(stream_index: int, volume_db: float)  
  
## Constants

MAX_STREAMS = `32`

Maximum amount of streams that can be synchronized.

## Property Descriptions

int stream_count = `0`

  * void set_stream_count(value: int)

  * int get_stream_count()

Set the total amount of streams that will be played back synchronized.

## Method Descriptions

AudioStream get_sync_stream(stream_index: int) const

Get one of the synchronized streams, by index.

float get_sync_stream_volume(stream_index: int) const

Get the volume of one of the synchronized streams, by index.

void set_sync_stream(stream_index: int, audio_stream: AudioStream)

Set one of the synchronized streams, by index.

void set_sync_stream_volume(stream_index: int, volume_db: float)

Set the volume of one of the synchronized streams, by index.
