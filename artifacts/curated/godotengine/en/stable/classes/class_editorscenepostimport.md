# EditorScenePostImport

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Post-processes scenes after import.

## Description

Imported scenes can be automatically modified right after import by setting
their Custom Script Import property to a `tool` script that inherits from this
class.

The _post_import() callback receives the imported scene's root node and
returns the modified version of the scene:

    @tool # Needed so it runs in editor.
    extends EditorScenePostImport
    
    # This sample changes all node names.
    # Called right after the scene is imported and gets the root node.
    func _post_import(scene):
        # Change all node names to "modified_[oldnodename]"
        iterate(scene)
        return scene # Remember to return the imported scene
    
    func iterate(node):
        if node != null:
            node.name = "modified_" + node.name
            for child in node.get_children():
                iterate(child)
    
    
    
    using Godot;
    
    // This sample changes all node names.
    // Called right after the scene is imported and gets the root node.
    [Tool]
    public partial class NodeRenamer : EditorScenePostImport
    {
        public override GodotObject _PostImport(Node scene)
        {
            // Change all node names to "modified_[oldnodename]"
            Iterate(scene);
            return scene; // Remember to return the imported scene
        }
    
        public void Iterate(Node node)
        {
            if (node != null)
            {
                node.Name = $"modified_{node.Name}";
                foreach (Node child in node.GetChildren())
                {
                    Iterate(child);
                }
            }
        }
    }
