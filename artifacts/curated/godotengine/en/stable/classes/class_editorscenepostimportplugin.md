## Method Descriptions

void _get_import_options(path: String) virtual

Override to add general import options. These will appear in the main import
dock on the editor. Add options via add_import_option() and
add_import_option_advanced().

void _get_internal_import_options(category: int) virtual

Override to add internal import options. These will appear in the 3D scene
import dialog. Add options via add_import_option() and
add_import_option_advanced().

Variant _get_internal_option_update_view_required(category: int, option:
String) virtual const

Should return `true` if the 3D view of the import dialog needs to update when
changing the given option.

Variant _get_internal_option_visibility(category: int, for_animation: bool,
option: String) virtual const

Should return `true` to show the given option, `false` to hide the given
option, or `null` to ignore.

Variant _get_option_visibility(path: String, for_animation: bool, option:
String) virtual const

Should return `true` to show the given option, `false` to hide the given
option, or `null` to ignore.

void _internal_process(category: int, base_node: Node, node: Node, resource:
Resource) virtual

Process a specific node or resource for a given category.

void _post_process(scene: Node) virtual

Post process the scene. This function is called after the final scene has been
configured.

void _pre_process(scene: Node) virtual

Pre Process the scene. This function is called right after the scene format
loader loaded the scene and no changes have been made.

Pre process may be used to adjust internal import options in the `"nodes"`,
`"meshes"`, `"animations"` or `"materials"` keys inside
`get_option_value("_subresources")`.

void add_import_option(name: String, value: Variant)

Add a specific import option (name and default value only). This function can
only be called from _get_import_options() and _get_internal_import_options().

void add_import_option_advanced(type: Variant.Type, name: String,
default_value: Variant, hint: PropertyHint = 0, hint_string: String = "",
usage_flags: int = 6)

Add a specific import option. This function can only be called from
_get_import_options() and _get_internal_import_options().

Variant get_option_value(name: StringName) const

Query the value of an option. This function can only be called from those
querying visibility, or processing.
