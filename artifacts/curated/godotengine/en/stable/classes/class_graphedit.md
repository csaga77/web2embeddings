# GraphEdit

Experimental: This class may be changed or removed in future versions.

Inherits: Control < CanvasItem < Node < Object

An editor for graph-like structures, using GraphNodes.

## Description

GraphEdit provides tools for creation, manipulation, and display of various
graphs. Its main purpose in the engine is to power the visual programming
systems, such as visual shaders, but it is also available for use in user
projects.

GraphEdit by itself is only an empty container, representing an infinite grid
where GraphNodes can be placed. Each GraphNode represents a node in the graph,
a single unit of data in the connected scheme. GraphEdit, in turn, helps to
control various interactions with nodes and between nodes. When the user
attempts to connect, disconnect, or delete a GraphNode, a signal is emitted in
the GraphEdit, but no action is taken by default. It is the responsibility of
the programmer utilizing this control to implement the necessary logic to
determine how each request should be handled.

Performance: It is greatly advised to enable low-processor usage mode (see
OS.low_processor_usage_mode) when using GraphEdits.

Note: Keep in mind that Node.get_children() will also return the connection
layer node named `_connection_layer` due to technical limitations. This
behavior may change in future releases.

## Method Descriptions

PackedVector2Array _get_connection_line(from_position: Vector2, to_position:
Vector2) virtual const

Virtual method which can be overridden to customize how connections are drawn.

bool _is_in_input_hotzone(in_node: Object, in_port: int, mouse_position:
Vector2) virtual

Returns whether the `mouse_position` is in the input hot zone.

By default, a hot zone is a Rect2 positioned such that its center is at
`in_node`.GraphNode.get_input_port_position()(`in_port`) (For output's case,
call GraphNode.get_output_port_position() instead). The hot zone's width is
twice the Theme Property `port_grab_distance_horizontal`, and its height is
twice the `port_grab_distance_vertical`.

Below is a sample code to help get started:

    
    
    func _is_in_input_hotzone(in_node, in_port, mouse_position):
        var port_size = Vector2(get_theme_constant("port_grab_distance_horizontal"), get_theme_constant("port_grab_distance_vertical"))
        var port_pos = in_node.get_position() + in_node.get_input_port_position(in_port) - port_size / 2
        var rect = Rect2(port_pos, port_size)
    
        return rect.has_point(mouse_position)
    

bool _is_in_output_hotzone(in_node: Object, in_port: int, mouse_position:
Vector2) virtual

Returns whether the `mouse_position` is in the output hot zone. For more
information on hot zones, see _is_in_input_hotzone().

Below is a sample code to help get started:

    
    
    func _is_in_output_hotzone(in_node, in_port, mouse_position):
        var port_size = Vector2(get_theme_constant("port_grab_distance_horizontal"), get_theme_constant("port_grab_distance_vertical"))
        var port_pos = in_node.get_position() + in_node.get_output_port_position(in_port) - port_size / 2
        var rect = Rect2(port_pos, port_size)
    
        return rect.has_point(mouse_position)
    

bool _is_node_hover_valid(from_node: StringName, from_port: int, to_node:
StringName, to_port: int) virtual

This virtual method can be used to insert additional error detection while the
user is dragging a connection over a valid port.

Return `true` if the connection is indeed valid or return `false` if the
connection is impossible. If the connection is impossible, no snapping to the
port and thus no connection request to that port will happen.

In this example a connection to same node is suppressed:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    func _is_node_hover_valid(from, from_port, to, to_port):
        return from != to
    
    
    
    public override bool _IsNodeHoverValid(StringName fromNode, int fromPort, StringName toNode, int toPort)
    {
        return fromNode != toNode;
    }
    

void add_valid_connection_type(from_type: int, to_type: int)

Allows the connection between two different port types. The port type is
defined individually for the left and the right port of each slot with the
GraphNode.set_slot() method.

See also is_valid_connection_type() and remove_valid_connection_type().

void add_valid_left_disconnect_type(type: int)

Allows to disconnect nodes when dragging from the left port of the GraphNode's
slot if it has the specified type. See also
remove_valid_left_disconnect_type().

void add_valid_right_disconnect_type(type: int)

Allows to disconnect nodes when dragging from the right port of the
GraphNode's slot if it has the specified type. See also
remove_valid_right_disconnect_type().

void arrange_nodes()

Rearranges selected nodes in a layout with minimum crossings between
connections and uniform horizontal and vertical gap between nodes.

void attach_graph_element_to_frame(element: StringName, frame: StringName)

Attaches the `element` GraphElement to the `frame` GraphFrame.

void clear_connections()

Removes all connections between nodes.

Error connect_node(from_node: StringName, from_port: int, to_node: StringName,
to_port: int, keep_alive: bool = false)

Create a connection between the `from_port` of the `from_node` GraphNode and
the `to_port` of the `to_node` GraphNode. If the connection already exists, no
connection is created.

Connections with `keep_alive` set to `false` may be deleted automatically if
invalid during a redraw.

void detach_graph_element_from_frame(element: StringName)

Detaches the `element` GraphElement from the GraphFrame it is currently
attached to.

void disconnect_node(from_node: StringName, from_port: int, to_node:
StringName, to_port: int)

Removes the connection between the `from_port` of the `from_node` GraphNode
and the `to_port` of the `to_node` GraphNode. If the connection does not
exist, no connection is removed.

void force_connection_drag_end()

Ends the creation of the current connection. In other words, if you are
dragging a connection you can use this method to abort the process and remove
the line that followed your cursor.

This is best used together with connection_drag_started and
connection_drag_ended to add custom behavior like node addition through
shortcuts.

Note: This method suppresses any other connection request signals apart from
connection_drag_ended.

Array[StringName] get_attached_nodes_of_frame(frame: StringName)

Returns an array of node names that are attached to the GraphFrame with the
given name.

Dictionary get_closest_connection_at_point(point: Vector2, max_distance: float
= 4.0) const

Returns the closest connection to the given point in screen space. If no
connection is found within `max_distance` pixels, an empty Dictionary is
returned.

A connection is represented as a Dictionary in the form of:

    
    
    {
        from_node: StringName,
        from_port: int,
        to_node: StringName,
        to_port: int,
        keep_alive: bool
    }
    

For example, getting a connection at a given mouse position can be achieved
like this:

GDScript

    
    
    var connection = get_closest_connection_at_point(mouse_event.get_position())
    

int get_connection_count(from_node: StringName, from_port: int)

Returns the number of connections from `from_port` of `from_node`.

PackedVector2Array get_connection_line(from_node: Vector2, to_node: Vector2)
const

Returns the points which would make up a connection between `from_node` and
`to_node`.

Array[Dictionary] get_connections_intersecting_with_rect(rect: Rect2) const

Returns an Array containing the list of connections that intersect with the
given Rect2.

A connection is represented as a Dictionary in the form of:

    
    
    {
        from_node: StringName,
        from_port: int,
        to_node: StringName,
        to_port: int,
        keep_alive: bool
    }
    

GraphFrame get_element_frame(element: StringName)

Returns the GraphFrame that contains the GraphElement with the given name.

HBoxContainer get_menu_hbox()

Gets the HBoxContainer that contains the zooming and grid snap controls in the
top left of the graph. You can use this method to reposition the toolbar or to
add your own custom controls to it.

Warning: This is a required internal node, removing and freeing it may cause a
crash. If you wish to hide it or any of its children, use their
CanvasItem.visible property.

bool is_node_connected(from_node: StringName, from_port: int, to_node:
StringName, to_port: int)

Returns `true` if the `from_port` of the `from_node` GraphNode is connected to
the `to_port` of the `to_node` GraphNode.

bool is_valid_connection_type(from_type: int, to_type: int) const

Returns whether it's possible to make a connection between two different port
types. The port type is defined individually for the left and the right port
of each slot with the GraphNode.set_slot() method.

See also add_valid_connection_type() and remove_valid_connection_type().

void remove_valid_connection_type(from_type: int, to_type: int)

Disallows the connection between two different port types previously allowed
by add_valid_connection_type(). The port type is defined individually for the
left and the right port of each slot with the GraphNode.set_slot() method.

See also is_valid_connection_type().

void remove_valid_left_disconnect_type(type: int)

Disallows to disconnect nodes when dragging from the left port of the
GraphNode's slot if it has the specified type. Use this to disable
disconnection previously allowed with add_valid_left_disconnect_type().

void remove_valid_right_disconnect_type(type: int)

Disallows to disconnect nodes when dragging from the right port of the
GraphNode's slot if it has the specified type. Use this to disable
disconnection previously allowed with add_valid_right_disconnect_type().

void set_connection_activity(from_node: StringName, from_port: int, to_node:
StringName, to_port: int, amount: float)

Sets the coloration of the connection between `from_node`'s `from_port` and
`to_node`'s `to_port` with the color provided in the activity theme property.
The color is linearly interpolated between the connection color and the
activity color using `amount` as weight.

void set_selected(node: Node)

Sets the specified `node` as the one selected.

## Theme Property Descriptions

Color activity = `Color(1, 1, 1, 1)`
