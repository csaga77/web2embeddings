# EditorResourceTooltipPlugin

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

A plugin that advanced tooltip for its handled resource type.

## Description

Resource tooltip plugins are used by FileSystemDock to generate customized
tooltips for specific resources. E.g. tooltip for a Texture2D displays a
bigger preview and the texture's dimensions.

A plugin must be first registered with
FileSystemDock.add_resource_tooltip_plugin(). When the user hovers a resource
in filesystem dock which is handled by the plugin, _make_tooltip_for_path() is
called to create the tooltip. It works similarly to
Control._make_custom_tooltip().

## Methods

bool | _handles(type: String) virtual const  
---|---  
Control | _make_tooltip_for_path(path: String, metadata: Dictionary, base: Control) virtual const  
void | request_thumbnail(path: String, control: TextureRect) const  
  
## Method Descriptions

bool _handles(type: String) virtual const

Return `true` if the plugin is going to handle the given Resource `type`.

Control _make_tooltip_for_path(path: String, metadata: Dictionary, base:
Control) virtual const

Create and return a tooltip that will be displayed when the user hovers a
resource under the given `path` in filesystem dock.

The `metadata` dictionary is provided by preview generator (see
EditorResourcePreviewGenerator._generate()).

`base` is the base default tooltip, which is a VBoxContainer with a file name,
type and size labels. If another plugin handled the same file type, `base`
will be output from the previous plugin. For best result, make sure the base
tooltip is part of the returned Control.

Note: It's unadvised to use ResourceLoader.load(), especially with heavy
resources like models or textures, because it will make the editor
unresponsive when creating the tooltip. You can use request_thumbnail() if you
want to display a preview in your tooltip.

Note: If you decide to discard the `base`, make sure to call
Node.queue_free(), because it's not freed automatically.

    
    
    func _make_tooltip_for_path(path, metadata, base):
        var t_rect = TextureRect.new()
        request_thumbnail(path, t_rect)
        base.add_child(t_rect) # The TextureRect will appear at the bottom of the tooltip.
        return base
    

void request_thumbnail(path: String, control: TextureRect) const

Requests a thumbnail for the given TextureRect. The thumbnail is created
asynchronously by EditorResourcePreview and automatically set when available.
