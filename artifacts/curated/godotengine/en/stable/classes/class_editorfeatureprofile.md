# EditorFeatureProfile

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

An editor feature profile which can be used to disable specific features.

## Description

An editor feature profile can be used to disable specific features of the
Godot editor. When disabled, the features won't appear in the editor, which
makes the editor less cluttered. This is useful in education settings to
reduce confusion or when working in a team. For example, artists and level
designers could use a feature profile that disables the script editor to avoid
accidentally making changes to files they aren't supposed to edit.

To manage editor feature profiles visually, use Editor > Manage Feature
Profiles... at the top of the editor window.

## Enumerations

enum Feature:

Feature FEATURE_3D = `0`

The 3D editor. If this feature is disabled, the 3D editor won't display but 3D
nodes will still display in the Create New Node dialog.

Feature FEATURE_SCRIPT = `1`

The Script tab, which contains the script editor and class reference browser.
If this feature is disabled, the Script tab won't display.

Feature FEATURE_ASSET_LIB = `2`

The AssetLib tab. If this feature is disabled, the AssetLib tab won't display.

Feature FEATURE_SCENE_TREE = `3`

Scene tree editing. If this feature is disabled, the Scene tree dock will
still be visible but will be read-only.

Feature FEATURE_NODE_DOCK = `4`

The Node dock. If this feature is disabled, signals and groups won't be
visible and modifiable from the editor.

Feature FEATURE_FILESYSTEM_DOCK = `5`

The FileSystem dock. If this feature is disabled, the FileSystem dock won't be

## Method Descriptions

String get_feature_name(feature: Feature)

Returns the specified `feature`'s human-readable name.

bool is_class_disabled(class_name: StringName) const

Returns `true` if the class specified by `class_name` is disabled. When
disabled, the class won't appear in the Create New Node dialog.

bool is_class_editor_disabled(class_name: StringName) const

Returns `true` if editing for the class specified by `class_name` is disabled.
When disabled, the class will still appear in the Create New Node dialog but
the Inspector will be read-only when selecting a node that extends the class.

bool is_class_property_disabled(class_name: StringName, property: StringName)
const

Returns `true` if `property` is disabled in the class specified by
`class_name`. When a property is disabled, it won't appear in the Inspector
when selecting a node that extends the class specified by `class_name`.

bool is_feature_disabled(feature: Feature) const

Returns `true` if the `feature` is disabled. When a feature is disabled, it
will disappear from the editor entirely.

Error load_from_file(path: String)

Loads an editor feature profile from a file. The file must follow the JSON
format obtained by using the feature profile manager's Export button or the
save_to_file() method.

Note: Feature profiles created via the user interface are loaded from the
`feature_profiles` directory, as a file with the `.profile` extension. The
editor configuration folder can be found by using
EditorPaths.get_config_dir().

Error save_to_file(path: String)

Saves the editor feature profile to a file in JSON format. It can then be
imported using the feature profile manager's Import button or the
load_from_file() method.

Note: Feature profiles created via the user interface are saved in the
`feature_profiles` directory, as a file with the `.profile` extension. The
editor configuration folder can be found by using
EditorPaths.get_config_dir().

void set_disable_class(class_name: StringName, disable: bool)

If `disable` is `true`, disables the class specified by `class_name`. When
disabled, the class won't appear in the Create New Node dialog.

void set_disable_class_editor(class_name: StringName, disable: bool)

If `disable` is `true`, disables editing for the class specified by
`class_name`. When disabled, the class will still appear in the Create New
Node dialog but the Inspector will be read-only when selecting a node that
extends the class.

void set_disable_class_property(class_name: StringName, property: StringName,
disable: bool)

If `disable` is `true`, disables editing for `property` in the class specified
by `class_name`. When a property is disabled, it won't appear in the Inspector
when selecting a node that extends the class specified by `class_name`.

void set_disable_feature(feature: Feature, disable: bool)

If `disable` is `true`, disables the editor feature specified in `feature`.
When a feature is disabled, it will disappear from the editor entirely.
