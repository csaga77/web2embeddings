# AtlasTexture

Inherits: Texture2D < Texture < Resource < RefCounted < Object

A texture that crops out part of another Texture2D.

## Description

Texture2D resource that draws only part of its atlas texture, as defined by
the region. An additional margin can also be set, which is useful for small
adjustments.

Multiple AtlasTexture resources can be cropped from the same atlas. Packing
many smaller textures into a singular large texture helps to optimize video
memory costs and render calls.

Note: AtlasTexture cannot be used in an AnimatedTexture, and will not tile
properly in nodes such as TextureRect or Sprite2D. To tile an AtlasTexture,
modify its region instead.

## Properties

Texture2D | atlas  
---|---  
bool | filter_clip | `false`  
Rect2 | margin | `Rect2(0, 0, 0, 0)`  
Rect2 | region | `Rect2(0, 0, 0, 0)`  
bool | resource_local_to_scene | `false` (overrides Resource)  
  
## Property Descriptions

Texture2D atlas

  * void set_atlas(value: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_atlas()

The texture that contains the atlas. Can be any type inheriting from
Texture2D, including another AtlasTexture.

bool filter_clip = `false`

  * void set_filter_clip(value: bool)

  * bool has_filter_clip()

If `true`, the area outside of the region is clipped to avoid bleeding of the
surrounding texture pixels.

Rect2 margin = `Rect2(0, 0, 0, 0)`

  * void set_margin(value: Rect2)

  * Rect2 get_margin()

The margin around the region. Useful for small adjustments. If the Rect2.size
of this property ("w" and "h" in the editor) is set, the drawn texture is
resized to fit within the margin.

Rect2 region = `Rect2(0, 0, 0, 0)`

  * void set_region(value: Rect2)

  * Rect2 get_region()

The region used to draw the atlas. If either dimension of the region's size is
`0`, the value from atlas size will be used for that axis instead.
