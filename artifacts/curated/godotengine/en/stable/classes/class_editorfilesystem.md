# EditorFileSystem

Inherits: Node < Object

Resource filesystem, as the editor sees it.

## Description

This object holds information of all resources in the filesystem, their types,
etc.

Note: This class shouldn't be instantiated directly. Instead, access the
singleton using EditorInterface.get_resource_filesystem().

## Methods

String | get_file_type(path: String) const  
---|---  
EditorFileSystemDirectory | get_filesystem()  
EditorFileSystemDirectory | get_filesystem_path(path: String)  
float | get_scanning_progress() const  
bool | is_scanning() const  
void | reimport_files(files: PackedStringArray)  
void | scan()  
void | scan_sources()  
void | update_file(path: String)  
  
## Signals

filesystem_changed()

Emitted if the filesystem changed.

resources_reimported(resources: PackedStringArray)

Emitted if a resource is reimported.

resources_reimporting(resources: PackedStringArray)

Emitted before a resource is reimported.

resources_reload(resources: PackedStringArray)

Emitted if at least one resource is reloaded when the filesystem is scanned.

script_classes_updated()

Emitted when the list of global script classes gets updated.

sources_changed(exist: bool)

Emitted if the source of any imported file changed.

## Method Descriptions

String get_file_type(path: String) const

Returns the resource type of the file, given the full path. This returns a
string such as `"Resource"` or `"GDScript"`, not a file extension such as
`".gd"`.

EditorFileSystemDirectory get_filesystem()

Gets the root directory object.

EditorFileSystemDirectory get_filesystem_path(path: String)

Returns a view into the filesystem at `path`.

float get_scanning_progress() const

Returns the scan progress for 0 to 1 if the FS is being scanned.

bool is_scanning() const

Returns `true` if the filesystem is being scanned.

void reimport_files(files: PackedStringArray)

Reimports a set of files. Call this if these files or their `.import` files
were directly edited by script or an external program.

If the file type changed or the file was newly created, use update_file() or
scan().

Note: This function blocks until the import is finished. However, the main
loop iteration, including timers and Node._process(), will occur during the
import process due to progress bar updates. Avoid calls to reimport_files() or
scan() while an import is in progress.

void scan()

Scan the filesystem for changes.

void scan_sources()

Check if the source of any imported resource changed.

void update_file(path: String)

Add a file in an existing directory, or schedule file information to be
updated on editor restart. Can be used to update text files saved by an
external program.

This will not import the file. To reimport, call reimport_files() or scan()
methods.
