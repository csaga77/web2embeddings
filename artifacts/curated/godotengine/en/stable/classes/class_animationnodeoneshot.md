# AnimationNodeOneShot

Inherits: AnimationNodeSync < AnimationNode < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Plays an animation once in an AnimationNodeBlendTree.

## Description

A resource to add to an AnimationNodeBlendTree. This animation node will
execute a sub-animation and return once it finishes. Blend times for fading in
and out can be customized, as well as filters.

After setting the request and changing the animation playback, the one-shot
node automatically clears the request on the next process frame by setting its
`request` value to ONE_SHOT_REQUEST_NONE.

    # Play child animation connected to "shot" port.

    # Alternative syntax (same result as above).
    animation_tree["parameters/OneShot/request"] = AnimationNodeOneShot.ONE_SHOT_REQUEST_FIRE
    
    # Abort child animation connected to "shot" port.

## Enumerations

enum OneShotRequest:

OneShotRequest ONE_SHOT_REQUEST_NONE = `0`

The default state of the request. Nothing is done.

OneShotRequest ONE_SHOT_REQUEST_FIRE = `1`

The request to play the animation connected to "shot" port.

OneShotRequest ONE_SHOT_REQUEST_ABORT = `2`

The request to stop the animation connected to "shot" port.

OneShotRequest ONE_SHOT_REQUEST_FADE_OUT = `3`

The request to fade out the animation connected to "shot" port.

enum MixMode:

MixMode MIX_MODE_BLEND = `0`

Blends two animations. See also AnimationNodeBlend2.

MixMode MIX_MODE_ADD = `1`

Blends two animations additively. See also AnimationNodeAdd2.

## Property Descriptions

bool autorestart = `false`

  * void set_autorestart(value: bool)

  * bool has_autorestart()

If `true`, the sub-animation will restart automatically after finishing.

In other words, to start auto restarting, the animation must be played once
with the ONE_SHOT_REQUEST_FIRE request. The ONE_SHOT_REQUEST_ABORT request
stops the auto restarting, but it does not disable the autorestart itself. So,
the ONE_SHOT_REQUEST_FIRE request will start auto restarting again.

float autorestart_delay = `1.0`

  * void set_autorestart_delay(value: float)

  * float get_autorestart_delay()

The delay after which the automatic restart is triggered, in seconds.

float autorestart_random_delay = `0.0`

  * void set_autorestart_random_delay(value: float)

  * float get_autorestart_random_delay()

If autorestart is `true`, a random additional delay (in seconds) between 0 and
this value will be added to autorestart_delay.

bool break_loop_at_end = `false`

  * void set_break_loop_at_end(value: bool)

  * bool is_loop_broken_at_end()

If `true`, breaks the loop at the end of the loop cycle for transition, even
if the animation is looping.

Curve fadein_curve

  * void set_fadein_curve(value: Curve)

  * Curve get_fadein_curve()

Determines how cross-fading between animations is eased. If empty, the
transition will be linear. Should be a unit Curve.

float fadein_time = `0.0`

  * void set_fadein_time(value: float)

  * float get_fadein_time()

The fade-in duration. For example, setting this to `1.0` for a 5 second length
animation will produce a cross-fade that starts at 0 second and ends at 1
second during the animation.

Note: AnimationNodeOneShot transitions the current state after the end of the
fading. When AnimationNodeOutput is considered as the most upstream, so the
fadein_time is scaled depending on the downstream delta. For example, if this
value is set to `1.0` and a AnimationNodeTimeScale with a value of `2.0` is
chained downstream, the actual processing time will be 0.5 second.

Curve fadeout_curve

  * void set_fadeout_curve(value: Curve)

  * Curve get_fadeout_curve()

Determines how cross-fading between animations is eased. If empty, the
transition will be linear. Should be a unit Curve.

float fadeout_time = `0.0`

  * void set_fadeout_time(value: float)

  * float get_fadeout_time()

The fade-out duration. For example, setting this to `1.0` for a 5 second
length animation will produce a cross-fade that starts at 4 second and ends at
5 second during the animation.

Note: AnimationNodeOneShot transitions the current state after the end of the
fading. When AnimationNodeOutput is considered as the most upstream, so the
fadeout_time is scaled depending on the downstream delta. For example, if this
value is set to `1.0` and an AnimationNodeTimeScale with a value of `2.0` is
chained downstream, the actual processing time will be 0.5 second.

MixMode mix_mode = `0`

  * void set_mix_mode(value: MixMode)

  * MixMode get_mix_mode()

The blend type.
