Object

A box-shaped region of 3D space that, when visible on screen, enables a target
node.

## Description

VisibleOnScreenEnabler3D contains a box-shaped region of 3D space and a target
node. The target node will be automatically enabled (via its Node.process_mode
property) when any part of this region becomes visible on the screen, and
automatically disabled otherwise. This can for example be used to activate
enemies only when the player approaches them.

See VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D if you only want to be notified when the region
is visible on screen.

Note: VisibleOnScreenEnabler3D uses an approximate heuristic that doesn't take
walls and other occlusion into account, unless occlusion culling is used. It
also won't function unless Node3D.visible is set to `true`.

## Properties

EnableMode | enable_mode | `0`  
---|---|---  
NodePath | enable_node_path | `NodePath("..")`  
  
## Enumerations

enum EnableMode:

EnableMode ENABLE_MODE_INHERIT = `0`

Corresponds to Node.PROCESS_MODE_INHERIT.

EnableMode ENABLE_MODE_ALWAYS = `1`

Corresponds to Node.PROCESS_MODE_ALWAYS.

EnableMode ENABLE_MODE_WHEN_PAUSED = `2`

Corresponds to Node.PROCESS_MODE_WHEN_PAUSED.

## Property Descriptions

EnableMode enable_mode = `0`

  * void set_enable_mode(value: EnableMode)

  * EnableMode get_enable_mode()

Determines how the target node is enabled. Corresponds to ProcessMode. When
the node is disabled, it always uses Node.PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED.

NodePath enable_node_path = `NodePath("..")`

  * void set_enable_node_path(value: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_enable_node_path()

The path to the target node, relative to the VisibleOnScreenEnabler3D. The
target node is cached; it's only assigned when setting this property (if the
VisibleOnScreenEnabler3D is inside the scene tree) and every time the
VisibleOnScreenEnabler3D enters the scene tree. If the path is empty, no node
will be affected. If the path is invalid, an error is also generated.
