## Description

The FBXState handles the state data imported from FBX files.

## Properties

bool | allow_geometry_helper_nodes | `false`  
---|---|---  
  
## Property Descriptions

bool allow_geometry_helper_nodes = `false`

  * void set_allow_geometry_helper_nodes(value: bool)

  * bool get_allow_geometry_helper_nodes()

If `true`, the import process used auxiliary nodes called geometry helper
nodes. These nodes help preserve the pivots and transformations of the
original 3D model during import.
