# StreamPeerGZIP

Experimental: This class may be changed or removed in future versions.

Inherits: StreamPeer < RefCounted < Object

A stream peer that handles GZIP and deflate compression/decompression.

## Description

This class allows to compress or decompress data using GZIP/deflate in a
streaming fashion. This is particularly useful when compressing or
decompressing files that have to be sent through the network without needing
to allocate them all in memory.

After starting the stream via start_compression() (or start_decompression()),
calling StreamPeer.put_partial_data() on this stream will compress (or
decompress) the data, writing it to the internal buffer. Calling
StreamPeer.get_available_bytes() will return the pending bytes in the internal
buffer, and StreamPeer.get_partial_data() will retrieve the compressed (or
decompressed) bytes from it. When the stream is over, you must call finish()
to ensure the internal buffer is properly flushed (make sure to call
StreamPeer.get_available_bytes() on last time to check if more data needs to
be read after that).

## Methods

void | clear()  
---|---  
Error | finish()  
Error | start_compression(use_deflate: bool = false, buffer_size: int = 65535)  
Error | start_decompression(use_deflate: bool = false, buffer_size: int = 65535)  
  
## Method Descriptions

void clear()

Clears this stream, resetting the internal state.

Error finish()

Finalizes the stream, compressing or decompressing any buffered chunk left.

Error start_compression(use_deflate: bool = false, buffer_size: int = 65535)

Start the stream in compression mode with the given `buffer_size`, if
`use_deflate` is `true` uses deflate instead of GZIP.

Error start_decompression(use_deflate: bool = false, buffer_size: int = 65535)

Start the stream in decompression mode with the given `buffer_size`, if
`use_deflate` is `true` uses deflate instead of GZIP.
