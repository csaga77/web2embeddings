# EditorResourceConversionPlugin

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Plugin for adding custom converters from one resource format to another in the
editor resource picker context menu; for example, converting a
StandardMaterial3D to a ShaderMaterial.

## Description

EditorResourceConversionPlugin is invoked when the context menu is brought up
for a resource in the editor inspector. Relevant conversion plugins will
appear as menu options to convert the given resource to a target type.

Below shows an example of a basic plugin that will convert an ImageTexture to
a PortableCompressedTexture2D.

GDScript

    
    
    extends EditorResourceConversionPlugin
    
    func _handles(resource: Resource):
        return resource is ImageTexture
    
    func _converts_to():
        return "PortableCompressedTexture2D"
    
    func _convert(itex: Resource):
        var ptex = PortableCompressedTexture2D.new()
        ptex.create_from_image(itex.get_image(), PortableCompressedTexture2D.COMPRESSION_MODE_LOSSLESS)
        return ptex
    

To use an EditorResourceConversionPlugin, register it using the
EditorPlugin.add_resource_conversion_plugin() method first.

## Methods

## Method Descriptions

Resource _convert(resource: Resource) virtual const

Takes an input Resource and converts it to the type given in _converts_to().
The returned Resource is the result of the conversion, and the input Resource
remains unchanged.

String _converts_to() virtual const

Returns the class name of the target type of Resource that this plugin
converts source resources to.

bool _handles(resource: Resource) virtual const

Called to determine whether a particular Resource can be converted to the
target resource type by this plugin.
