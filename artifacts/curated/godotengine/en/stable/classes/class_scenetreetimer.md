# SceneTreeTimer

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

One-shot timer.

## Description

A one-shot timer managed by the scene tree, which emits timeout on completion.
See also SceneTree.create_timer().

As opposed to Timer, it does not require the instantiation of a node. Commonly
used to create a one-shot delay timer as in the following example:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    func some_function():
        print("Timer started.")
        await get_tree().create_timer(1.0).timeout
        print("Timer ended.")
    
    
    
    public async Task SomeFunction()
    {
        GD.Print("Timer started.");
        await ToSignal(GetTree().CreateTimer(1.0f), SceneTreeTimer.SignalName.Timeout);
        GD.Print("Timer ended.");
    }
    

The timer will be dereferenced after its time elapses. To preserve the timer,
you can keep a reference to it. See RefCounted.

Note: The timer is processed after all of the nodes in the current frame, i.e.
node's Node._process() method would be called before the timer (or
Node._physics_process() if `process_in_physics` in SceneTree.create_timer()
has been set to `true`).
