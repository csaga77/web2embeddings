# PathFollow2D

Inherits: Node2D < CanvasItem < Node < Object

Point sampler for a Path2D.

## Description

This node takes its parent Path2D, and returns the coordinates of a point
within it, given a distance from the first vertex.

It is useful for making other nodes follow a path, without coding the movement
pattern. For that, the nodes must be children of this node. The descendant
nodes will then move accordingly when setting the progress in this node.

## Properties

float | h_offset | `0.0`  
bool | loop | `true`  
float | progress | `0.0`  
float | progress_ratio | `0.0`  
bool | rotates | `true`  
float | v_offset | `0.0`  
  
## Property Descriptions

bool cubic_interp = `true`

  * void set_cubic_interpolation(value: bool)

  * bool get_cubic_interpolation()

If `true`, the position between two cached points is interpolated cubically,
and linearly otherwise.

The points along the Curve2D of the Path2D are precomputed before use, for
faster calculations. The point at the requested offset is then calculated
interpolating between two adjacent cached points. This may present a problem
if the curve makes sharp turns, as the cached points may not follow the curve
closely enough.

There are two answers to this problem: either increase the number of cached
points and increase memory consumption, or make a cubic interpolation between
two points at the cost of (slightly) slower calculations.

float h_offset = `0.0`

  * void set_h_offset(value: float)

  * float get_h_offset()

The node's offset along the curve.

bool loop = `true`

  * void set_loop(value: bool)

  * bool has_loop()

If `true`, any offset outside the path's length will wrap around, instead of
stopping at the ends. Use it for cyclic paths.

float progress = `0.0`

  * void set_progress(value: float)

  * float get_progress()

The distance along the path, in pixels. Changing this value sets this node's
position to a point within the path.

float progress_ratio = `0.0`

  * void set_progress_ratio(value: float)

  * float get_progress_ratio()

The distance along the path as a number in the range 0.0 (for the first
vertex) to 1.0 (for the last). This is just another way of expressing the
progress within the path, as the offset supplied is multiplied internally by
the path's length.

It can be set or get only if the PathFollow2D is the child of a Path2D which
is part of the scene tree, and that this Path2D has a Curve2D with a non-zero
length. Otherwise, trying to set this field will print an error, and getting
this field will return `0.0`.

bool rotates = `true`

  * void set_rotates(value: bool)

  * bool is_rotating()

If `true`, this node rotates to follow the path, with the +X direction facing
forward on the path.

float v_offset = `0.0`

  * void set_v_offset(value: float)

  * float get_v_offset()

The node's offset perpendicular to the curve.
