# KinematicCollision3D

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Holds collision data from the movement of a PhysicsBody3D.

## Description

Holds collision data from the movement of a PhysicsBody3D, usually from
PhysicsBody3D.move_and_collide(). When a PhysicsBody3D is moved, it stops if
it detects a collision with another body. If a collision is detected, a
KinematicCollision3D object is returned.

The collision data includes the colliding object, the remaining motion, and
the collision position. This data can be used to determine a custom response
to the collision.

## Method Descriptions

float get_angle(collision_index: int = 0, up_direction: Vector3 = Vector3(0,
1, 0)) const

Returns the collision angle according to `up_direction`, which is Vector3.UP
by default. This value is always positive.

Object get_collider(collision_index: int = 0) const

Returns the colliding body's attached Object given a collision index (the
deepest collision by default).

int get_collider_id(collision_index: int = 0) const

Returns the unique instance ID of the colliding body's attached Object given a
collision index (the deepest collision by default). See
Object.get_instance_id().

RID get_collider_rid(collision_index: int = 0) const

Returns the colliding body's RID used by the PhysicsServer3D given a collision
index (the deepest collision by default).

Object get_collider_shape(collision_index: int = 0) const

Returns the colliding body's shape given a collision index (the deepest
collision by default).

int get_collider_shape_index(collision_index: int = 0) const

Returns the colliding body's shape index given a collision index (the deepest
collision by default). See CollisionObject3D.

Vector3 get_collider_velocity(collision_index: int = 0) const

Returns the colliding body's velocity given a collision index (the deepest
collision by default).

int get_collision_count() const

Returns the number of detected collisions.

float get_depth() const

Returns the colliding body's length of overlap along the collision normal.

Object get_local_shape(collision_index: int = 0) const

Returns the moving object's colliding shape given a collision index (the
deepest collision by default).

Vector3 get_normal(collision_index: int = 0) const

Returns the colliding body's shape's normal at the point of collision given a
collision index (the deepest collision by default).

Vector3 get_position(collision_index: int = 0) const

Returns the point of collision in global coordinates given a collision index
(the deepest collision by default).

Vector3 get_remainder() const

Returns the moving object's remaining movement vector.

Vector3 get_travel() const

Returns the moving object's travel before collision.
