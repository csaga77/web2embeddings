# MarginContainer

Inherits: Container < Control < CanvasItem < Node < Object

A container that keeps a margin around its child controls.

## Description

MarginContainer adds an adjustable margin on each side of its child controls.
The margins are added around all children, not around each individual one. To
control the MarginContainer's margins, use the `margin_*` theme properties
listed below.

Note: The margin sizes are theme overrides, not normal properties. This is an
example of how to change them in code:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    # This code sample assumes the current script is extending MarginContainer.
    var margin_value = 100
    add_theme_constant_override("margin_top", margin_value)
    add_theme_constant_override("margin_left", margin_value)
    add_theme_constant_override("margin_bottom", margin_value)
    add_theme_constant_override("margin_right", margin_value)
    
    
    
    // This code sample assumes the current script is extending MarginContainer.
    int marginValue = 100;
    AddThemeConstantOverride("margin_top", marginValue);
    AddThemeConstantOverride("margin_left", marginValue);
    AddThemeConstantOverride("margin_bottom", marginValue);
    AddThemeConstantOverride("margin_right", marginValue);
