Abstract base class for 2D physics objects.

## Description

Abstract base class for 2D physics objects. CollisionObject2D can hold any
number of Shape2Ds for collision. Each shape must be assigned to a shape
owner. Shape owners are not nodes and do not appear in the editor, but are
accessible through code using the `shape_owner_*` methods.

Note: Only collisions between objects within the same canvas (Viewport canvas
or CanvasLayer) are supported. The behavior of collisions between objects in
different canvases is undefined.

## Signals

input_event(viewport: Node, event: InputEvent, shape_idx: int)

Emitted when an input event occurs. Requires input_pickable to be `true` and
at least one collision_layer bit to be set. See _input_event() for details.

mouse_entered()

Emitted when the mouse pointer enters any of this object's shapes. Requires
input_pickable to be `true` and at least one collision_layer bit to be set.
Note that moving between different shapes within a single CollisionObject2D
won't cause this signal to be emitted.

Note: Due to the lack of continuous collision detection, this signal may not
be emitted in the expected order if the mouse moves fast enough and the
CollisionObject2D's area is small. This signal may also not be emitted if
another CollisionObject2D is overlapping the CollisionObject2D in question.

mouse_exited()

Emitted when the mouse pointer exits all this object's shapes. Requires
input_pickable to be `true` and at least one collision_layer bit to be set.
Note that moving between different shapes within a single CollisionObject2D
won't cause this signal to be emitted.

Note: Due to the lack of continuous collision detection, this signal may not
be emitted in the expected order if the mouse moves fast enough and the
CollisionObject2D's area is small. This signal may also not be emitted if
another CollisionObject2D is overlapping the CollisionObject2D in question.

mouse_shape_entered(shape_idx: int)

Emitted when the mouse pointer enters any of this object's shapes or moves
from one shape to another. `shape_idx` is the child index of the newly entered
Shape2D. Requires input_pickable to be `true` and at least one collision_layer
bit to be set.

mouse_shape_exited(shape_idx: int)

Emitted when the mouse pointer exits any of this object's shapes. `shape_idx`
is the child index of the exited Shape2D. Requires input_pickable to be `true`
and at least one collision_layer bit to be set.

## Enumerations

enum DisableMode:

DisableMode DISABLE_MODE_REMOVE = `0`

When Node.process_mode is set to Node.PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED, remove from the
physics simulation to stop all physics interactions with this
CollisionObject2D.

Automatically re-added to the physics simulation when the Node is processed
again.

DisableMode DISABLE_MODE_MAKE_STATIC = `1`

When Node.process_mode is set to Node.PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED, make the body
static. Doesn't affect Area2D. PhysicsBody2D can't be affected by forces or
other bodies while static.

Automatically set PhysicsBody2D back to its original mode when the Node is
processed again.

DisableMode DISABLE_MODE_KEEP_ACTIVE = `2`

When Node.process_mode is set to Node.PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED, do not affect the
physics simulation.

## Property Descriptions

int collision_layer = `1`

  * void set_collision_layer(value: int)

  * int get_collision_layer()

The physics layers this CollisionObject2D is in. Collision objects can exist
in one or more of 32 different layers. See also collision_mask.

Note: Object A can detect a contact with object B only if object B is in any
of the layers that object A scans. See Collision layers and masks in the
documentation for more information.

int collision_mask = `1`

  * void set_collision_mask(value: int)

  * int get_collision_mask()

The physics layers this CollisionObject2D scans. Collision objects can scan
one or more of 32 different layers. See also collision_layer.

Note: Object A can detect a contact with object B only if object B is in any
of the layers that object A scans. See Collision layers and masks in the
documentation for more information.

float collision_priority = `1.0`

  * void set_collision_priority(value: float)

  * float get_collision_priority()

The priority used to solve colliding when occurring penetration. The higher
the priority is, the lower the penetration into the object will be. This can
for example be used to prevent the player from breaking through the boundaries
of a level.

DisableMode disable_mode = `0`

  * void set_disable_mode(value: DisableMode)

  * DisableMode get_disable_mode()

Defines the behavior in physics when Node.process_mode is set to
Node.PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED. See DisableMode for more details about the
different modes.

bool input_pickable = `true`

  * void set_pickable(value: bool)

  * bool is_pickable()

If `true`, this object is pickable. A pickable object can detect the mouse
pointer entering/leaving, and if the mouse is inside it, report input events.
Requires at least one collision_layer bit to be set.

## Method Descriptions

void _input_event(viewport: Viewport, event: InputEvent, shape_idx: int)
virtual

Accepts unhandled InputEvents. `shape_idx` is the child index of the clicked

won't cause this function to be called.

void _mouse_exit() virtual

Called when the mouse pointer exits all this object's shapes. Requires
input_pickable to be `true` and at least one collision_layer bit to be set.
Note that moving between different shapes within a single CollisionObject2D

bit to be called.
