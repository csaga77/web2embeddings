Casts light in a 2D environment.

## Description

Casts light in a 2D environment. A light is defined as a color, an energy
value, a mode (see constants), and various other parameters (range and
shadows-related).

## Tutorials

  * 2D lights and shadows

## Enumerations

enum ShadowFilter:

ShadowFilter SHADOW_FILTER_NONE = `0`

No filter applies to the shadow map. This provides hard shadow edges and is
the fastest to render. See shadow_filter.

ShadowFilter SHADOW_FILTER_PCF5 = `1`

Percentage closer filtering (5 samples) applies to the shadow map. This is
slower compared to hard shadow rendering. See shadow_filter.

ShadowFilter SHADOW_FILTER_PCF13 = `2`

Percentage closer filtering (13 samples) applies to the shadow map. This is
the slowest shadow filtering mode, and should be used sparingly. See
shadow_filter.

enum BlendMode:

BlendMode BLEND_MODE_ADD = `0`

Adds the value of pixels corresponding to the Light2D to the values of pixels
under it. This is the common behavior of a light.

BlendMode BLEND_MODE_SUB = `1`

Subtracts the value of pixels corresponding to the Light2D to the values of
pixels under it, resulting in inversed light effect.

BlendMode BLEND_MODE_MIX = `2`

Mix the value of pixels corresponding to the Light2D to the values of pixels
under it by linear interpolation.

## Property Descriptions

BlendMode blend_mode = `0`

  * void set_blend_mode(value: BlendMode)

  * BlendMode get_blend_mode()

The Light2D's blend mode. See BlendMode constants for values.

Color color = `Color(1, 1, 1, 1)`

  * void set_color(value: Color)

  * Color get_color()

The Light2D's Color.

bool editor_only = `false`

  * void set_editor_only(value: bool)

  * bool is_editor_only()

If `true`, Light2D will only appear when editing the scene.

bool enabled = `true`

  * void set_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_enabled()

If `true`, Light2D will emit light.

float energy = `1.0`

  * void set_energy(value: float)

  * float get_energy()

The Light2D's energy value. The larger the value, the stronger the light.

int range_item_cull_mask = `1`

  * void set_item_cull_mask(value: int)

  * int get_item_cull_mask()

The layer mask. Only objects with a matching CanvasItem.light_mask will be
affected by the Light2D. See also shadow_item_cull_mask, which affects which
objects can cast shadows.

Note: range_item_cull_mask is ignored by DirectionalLight2D, which will always
light a 2D node regardless of the 2D node's CanvasItem.light_mask.

int range_layer_max = `0`

  * void set_layer_range_max(value: int)

  * int get_layer_range_max()

Maximum layer value of objects that are affected by the Light2D.

int range_layer_min = `0`

  * void set_layer_range_min(value: int)

  * int get_layer_range_min()

Minimum layer value of objects that are affected by the Light2D.

int range_z_max = `1024`

  * void set_z_range_max(value: int)

  * int get_z_range_max()

Maximum `z` value of objects that are affected by the Light2D.

int range_z_min = `-1024`

  * void set_z_range_min(value: int)

  * int get_z_range_min()

Minimum `z` value of objects that are affected by the Light2D.

Color shadow_color = `Color(0, 0, 0, 0)`

  * void set_shadow_color(value: Color)

  * Color get_shadow_color()

Color of shadows cast by the Light2D.

bool shadow_enabled = `false`

  * void set_shadow_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_shadow_enabled()

If `true`, the Light2D will cast shadows.

ShadowFilter shadow_filter = `0`

  * void set_shadow_filter(value: ShadowFilter)

  * ShadowFilter get_shadow_filter()

Shadow filter type. See ShadowFilter for possible values.

float shadow_filter_smooth = `0.0`

  * void set_shadow_smooth(value: float)

  * float get_shadow_smooth()

Smoothing value for shadows. Higher values will result in softer shadows, at
the cost of visible streaks that can appear in shadow rendering.
shadow_filter_smooth only has an effect if shadow_filter is SHADOW_FILTER_PCF5
or SHADOW_FILTER_PCF13.

int shadow_item_cull_mask = `1`

  * void set_item_shadow_cull_mask(value: int)

  * int get_item_shadow_cull_mask()

The shadow mask. Used with LightOccluder2D to cast shadows. Only occluders
with a matching CanvasItem.light_mask will cast shadows. See also
range_item_cull_mask, which affects which objects can receive the light.

## Method Descriptions

float get_height() const

Returns the light's height, which is used in 2D normal mapping. See
PointLight2D.height and DirectionalLight2D.height.

void set_height(height: float)

Sets the light's height, which is used in 2D normal mapping. See
PointLight2D.height and DirectionalLight2D.height.
