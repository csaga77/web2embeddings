# XRBodyTracker

Experimental: This class may be changed or removed in future versions.

Inherits: XRPositionalTracker < XRTracker < RefCounted < Object

A tracked body in XR.

## Description

A body tracking system will create an instance of this object and add it to
the XRServer. This tracking system will then obtain skeleton data, convert it
to the Godot Humanoid skeleton and store this data on the XRBodyTracker
object.

Use XRBodyModifier3D to animate a body mesh using body tracking data.
