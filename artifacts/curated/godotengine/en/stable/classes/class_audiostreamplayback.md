## Method Descriptions

int _get_loop_count() virtual const

Overridable method. Should return how many times this audio stream has looped.
Most built-in playbacks always return `0`.

Variant _get_parameter(name: StringName) virtual const

Return the current value of a playback parameter by name (see
AudioStream._get_parameter_list()).

float _get_playback_position() virtual const

Overridable method. Should return the current progress along the audio stream,
in seconds.

bool _is_playing() virtual const

Overridable method. Should return `true` if this playback is active and
playing its audio stream.

int _mix(buffer: `AudioFrame*`, rate_scale: float, frames: int) virtual

Override this method to customize how the audio stream is mixed. This method
is called even if the playback is not active.

Note: It is not useful to override this method in GDScript or C#. Only
GDExtension can take advantage of it.

void _seek(position: float) virtual

Override this method to customize what happens when seeking this audio stream
at the given `position`, such as by calling AudioStreamPlayer.seek().

void _set_parameter(name: StringName, value: Variant) virtual

Set the current value of a playback parameter by name (see
AudioStream._get_parameter_list()).

void _start(from_pos: float) virtual

Override this method to customize what happens when the playback starts at the
given position, such as by calling AudioStreamPlayer.play().

void _stop() virtual

Override this method to customize what happens when the playback is stopped,
such as by calling AudioStreamPlayer.stop().

void _tag_used_streams() virtual

Overridable method. Called whenever the audio stream is mixed if the playback
is active and AudioServer.set_enable_tagging_used_audio_streams() has been set
to `true`. Editor plugins may use this method to "tag" the current position
along the audio stream and display it in a preview.

int get_loop_count() const

Returns the number of times the stream has looped.

float get_playback_position() const

Returns the current position in the stream, in seconds.

AudioSamplePlayback get_sample_playback() const

Experimental: This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Returns the AudioSamplePlayback associated with this AudioStreamPlayback for
playing back the audio sample of this stream.

bool is_playing() const

Returns `true` if the stream is playing.

PackedVector2Array mix_audio(rate_scale: float, frames: int)

Mixes up to `frames` of audio from the stream from the current position, at a
rate of `rate_scale`, advancing the stream.

Returns a PackedVector2Array where each element holds the left and right
channel volume levels of each frame.

Note: Can return fewer frames than requested, make sure to use the size of the
return value.

void seek(time: float = 0.0)

Seeks the stream at the given `time`, in seconds.

void set_sample_playback(playback_sample: AudioSamplePlayback)

Experimental: This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Associates AudioSamplePlayback to this AudioStreamPlayback for playing back
the audio sample of this stream.

void start(from_pos: float = 0.0)

Starts the stream from the given `from_pos`, in seconds.

void stop()

Stops the stream.
