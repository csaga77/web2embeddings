# CSGPolygon3D

Inherits: CSGPrimitive3D < CSGShape3D < GeometryInstance3D < VisualInstance3D

Extrudes a 2D polygon shape to create a 3D mesh.

## Description

An array of 2D points is extruded to quickly and easily create a variety of 3D
meshes. See also CSGMesh3D for using 3D meshes as CSG nodes.

Note: CSG nodes are intended to be used for level prototyping. Creating CSG
nodes has a significant CPU cost compared to creating a MeshInstance3D with a
PrimitiveMesh. Moving a CSG node within another CSG node also has a
significant CPU cost, so it should be avoided during gameplay.

## Enumerations

enum Mode:

Mode MODE_DEPTH = `0`

The polygon shape is extruded along the negative Z axis.

Mode MODE_SPIN = `1`

The polygon shape is extruded by rotating it around the Y axis.

Mode MODE_PATH = `2`

The polygon shape is extruded along the Path3D specified in path_node.

enum PathRotation:

PathRotation PATH_ROTATION_POLYGON = `0`

The polygon shape is not rotated.

Note: Requires the path Z coordinates to continually decrease to ensure viable
shapes.

PathRotation PATH_ROTATION_PATH = `1`

The polygon shape is rotated along the path, but it is not rotated around the
path axis.

Note: Requires the path Z coordinates to continually decrease to ensure viable
shapes.

PathRotation PATH_ROTATION_PATH_FOLLOW = `2`

The polygon shape follows the path and its rotations around the path axis.

enum PathIntervalType:

PathIntervalType PATH_INTERVAL_DISTANCE = `0`

When mode is set to MODE_PATH, path_interval will determine the distance, in
meters, each interval of the path will extrude.

PathIntervalType PATH_INTERVAL_SUBDIVIDE = `1`

When mode is set to MODE_PATH, path_interval will subdivide the polygons along
the path.

## Property Descriptions

float depth = `1.0`

  * void set_depth(value: float)

  * float get_depth()

When mode is MODE_DEPTH, the depth of the extrusion.

Material material

  * void set_material(value: Material)

  * Material get_material()

Material to use for the resulting mesh. The UV maps the top half of the
material to the extruded shape (U along the length of the extrusions and V
around the outline of the polygon), the bottom-left quarter to the front end
face, and the bottom-right quarter to the back end face.

Mode mode = `0`

  * void set_mode(value: Mode)

  * Mode get_mode()

The mode used to extrude the polygon.

bool path_continuous_u

  * void set_path_continuous_u(value: bool)

  * bool is_path_continuous_u()

When mode is MODE_PATH, by default, the top half of the material is stretched
along the entire length of the extruded shape. If `false` the top half of the
material is repeated every step of the extrusion.

float path_interval

  * void set_path_interval(value: float)

  * float get_path_interval()

When mode is MODE_PATH, the path interval or ratio of path points to
extrusions.

PathIntervalType path_interval_type

  * void set_path_interval_type(value: PathIntervalType)

  * PathIntervalType get_path_interval_type()

When mode is MODE_PATH, this will determine if the interval should be by
distance (PATH_INTERVAL_DISTANCE) or subdivision fractions
(PATH_INTERVAL_SUBDIVIDE).

bool path_joined

  * void set_path_joined(value: bool)

  * bool is_path_joined()

When mode is MODE_PATH, if `true` the ends of the path are joined, by adding
an extrusion between the last and first points of the path.

bool path_local

  * void set_path_local(value: bool)

  * bool is_path_local()

When mode is MODE_PATH, if `true` the Transform3D of the CSGPolygon3D is used
as the starting point for the extrusions, not the Transform3D of the
path_node.

NodePath path_node

  * void set_path_node(value: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_path_node()

When mode is MODE_PATH, the location of the Path3D object used to extrude the
polygon.

PathRotation path_rotation

  * void set_path_rotation(value: PathRotation)

  * PathRotation get_path_rotation()

When mode is MODE_PATH, the path rotation method used to rotate the polygon as
it is extruded.

bool path_rotation_accurate

  * void set_path_rotation_accurate(value: bool)

  * bool get_path_rotation_accurate()

When mode is MODE_PATH, if `true` the polygon will be rotated according to the
proper tangent of the path at the sampled points. If `false` an approximation
is used, which decreases in accuracy as the number of subdivisions decreases.

float path_simplify_angle

  * void set_path_simplify_angle(value: float)

  * float get_path_simplify_angle()

When mode is MODE_PATH, extrusions that are less than this angle, will be
merged together to reduce polygon count.

float path_u_distance

  * void set_path_u_distance(value: float)

  * float get_path_u_distance()

When mode is MODE_PATH, this is the distance along the path, in meters, the
texture coordinates will tile. When set to 0, texture coordinates will match
geometry exactly with no tiling.

PackedVector2Array polygon = `PackedVector2Array(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0)`

  * void set_polygon(value: PackedVector2Array)

  * PackedVector2Array get_polygon()

The point array that defines the 2D polygon that is extruded. This can be a
convex or concave polygon with 3 or more points. The polygon must not have any
intersecting edges. Otherwise, triangulation will fail and no mesh will be
generated.

Note: If only 1 or 2 points are defined in polygon, no mesh will be generated.

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedVector2Array for more details.

bool smooth_faces = `false`

  * void set_smooth_faces(value: bool)

  * bool get_smooth_faces()

If `true`, applies smooth shading to the extrusions.

float spin_degrees

  * void set_spin_degrees(value: float)

  * float get_spin_degrees()

When mode is MODE_SPIN, the total number of degrees the polygon is rotated
when extruding.

int spin_sides

  * void set_spin_sides(value: int)

  * int get_spin_sides()

When mode is MODE_SPIN, the number of extrusions made.
