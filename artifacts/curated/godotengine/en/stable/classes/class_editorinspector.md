# EditorInspector

Inherits: ScrollContainer < Container < Control < CanvasItem < Node < Object

A control used to edit properties of an object.

## Description

This is the control that implements property editing in the editor's Settings
dialogs, the Inspector dock, etc. To get the EditorInspector used in the
editor's Inspector dock, use EditorInterface.get_inspector().

EditorInspector will show properties in the same order as the array returned
by Object.get_property_list().

If a property's name is path-like (i.e. if it contains forward slashes),
EditorInspector will create nested sections for "directories" along the path.
For example, if a property is named `highlighting/gdscript/node_path_color`,
it will be shown as "Node Path Color" inside the "GDScript" section nested
inside the "Highlighting" section.

If a property has @GlobalScope.PROPERTY_USAGE_GROUP usage, it will group
subsequent properties whose name starts with the property's hint string. The
group ends when a property does not start with that hint string or when a new
group starts. An empty group name effectively ends the current group.
EditorInspector will create a top-level section for each group. For example,
if a property with group usage is named `Collide With` and its hint string is
`collide_with_`, a subsequent `collide_with_area` property will be shown as
"Area" inside the "Collide With" section. There is also a special case: when
the hint string contains the name of a property, that property is grouped too.
This is mainly to help grouping properties like `font`, `font_color` and
`font_size` (using the hint string `font_`).

If a property has @GlobalScope.PROPERTY_USAGE_SUBGROUP usage, a subgroup will
be created in the same way as a group, and a second-level section will be
created for each subgroup.

Note: Unlike sections created from path-like property names, EditorInspector
won't capitalize the name for sections created from groups. So properties with
group usage usually use capitalized names instead of snake_cased names.

## Properties

bool | draw_focus_border | `true` (overrides ScrollContainer)  
---|---|---  
FocusMode | focus_mode | `2` (overrides Control)  
ScrollMode | horizontal_scroll_mode | `0` (overrides ScrollContainer)  
  
## Methods

void | edit(object: Object)  
---|---  
Object | get_edited_object()  
String | get_selected_path() const  
EditorProperty | instantiate_property_editor(object: Object, type: Variant.Type, path: String, hint: PropertyHint, hint_text: String, usage: int, wide: bool = false) static  
  
## Signals

edited_object_changed()

Emitted when the object being edited by the inspector has changed.

object_id_selected(id: int)

Emitted when the Edit button of an Object has been pressed in the inspector.
This is mainly used in the remote scene tree Inspector.

property_deleted(property: String)

Emitted when a property is removed from the inspector.

property_edited(property: String)

Emitted when a property is edited in the inspector.

property_keyed(property: String, value: Variant, advance: bool)

Emitted when a property is keyed in the inspector. Properties can be keyed by
clicking the "key" icon next to a property when the Animation panel is
toggled.

property_selected(property: String)

Emitted when a property is selected in the inspector.

property_toggled(property: String, checked: bool)

Emitted when a boolean property is toggled in the inspector.

Note: This signal is never emitted if the internal `autoclear` property
enabled. Since this property is always enabled in the editor inspector, this
signal is never emitted by the editor itself.

resource_selected(resource: Resource, path: String)

Emitted when a resource is selected in the inspector.

restart_requested()

Emitted when a property that requires a restart to be applied is edited in the
inspector. This is only used in the Project Settings and Editor Settings.

## Method Descriptions

void edit(object: Object)

Shows the properties of the given `object` in this inspector for editing. To
clear the inspector, call this method with `null`.

Note: If you want to edit an object in the editor's main inspector, use the
`edit_*` methods in EditorInterface instead.

Object get_edited_object()

Returns the object currently selected in this inspector.

String get_selected_path() const

Gets the path of the currently selected property.

EditorProperty instantiate_property_editor(object: Object, type: Variant.Type,
path: String, hint: PropertyHint, hint_text: String, usage: int, wide: bool =
false) static

Creates a property editor that can be used by plugin UI to edit the specified
property of an `object`.

  *[void]: No return value.
  *[const]: This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.
  *[static]: This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.
