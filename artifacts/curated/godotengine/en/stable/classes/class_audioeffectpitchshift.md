# AudioEffectPitchShift

Inherits: AudioEffect < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Adds a pitch-shifting audio effect to an audio bus.

Raises or lowers the pitch of original sound.

## Description

Allows modulation of pitch independently of tempo. All frequencies can be
increased/decreased with minimal effect on transients.

## Tutorials

  * Audio buses

## Properties

FFTSize | fft_size | `3`  
---|---|---  
int | oversampling | `4`  
float | pitch_scale | `1.0`  
  
## Enumerations

enum FFTSize:

FFTSize FFT_SIZE_256 = `0`

Use a buffer of 256 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. Lowest latency,
but least stable over time.

FFTSize FFT_SIZE_512 = `1`

Use a buffer of 512 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. Low latency, but
less stable over time.

FFTSize FFT_SIZE_1024 = `2`

Use a buffer of 1024 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. This is a
compromise between latency and stability over time.

FFTSize FFT_SIZE_2048 = `3`

Use a buffer of 2048 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. High latency, but
stable over time.

FFTSize FFT_SIZE_4096 = `4`

Use a buffer of 4096 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. Highest latency,
but most stable over time.

FFTSize FFT_SIZE_MAX = `5`

Represents the size of the FFTSize enum.

## Property Descriptions

FFTSize fft_size = `3`

  * void set_fft_size(value: FFTSize)

  * FFTSize get_fft_size()

The size of the Fast Fourier transform buffer. Higher values smooth out the
effect over time, but have greater latency. The effects of this higher latency
are especially noticeable on sounds that have sudden amplitude changes.

int oversampling = `4`

  * void set_oversampling(value: int)

  * int get_oversampling()

The oversampling factor to use. Higher values result in better quality, but
are more demanding on the CPU and may cause audio cracking if the CPU can't
keep up.

float pitch_scale = `1.0`

  * void set_pitch_scale(value: float)

  * float get_pitch_scale()

The pitch scale to use. `1.0` is the default pitch and plays sounds
unaffected. pitch_scale can range from `0.0` (infinitely low pitch, inaudible)
to `16` (16 times higher than the initial pitch).
