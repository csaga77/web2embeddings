# JavaScriptBridge

Inherits: Object

Singleton that connects the engine with the browser's JavaScript context in
Web export.

## Description

The JavaScriptBridge singleton is implemented only in the Web export. It's
used to access the browser's JavaScript context. This allows interaction with
embedding pages or calling third-party JavaScript APIs.

Note: This singleton can be disabled at build-time to improve security. By
default, the JavaScriptBridge singleton is enabled. Official export templates
also have the JavaScriptBridge singleton enabled. See Compiling for the Web in
the documentation for more information.

## Signals

pwa_update_available()

Emitted when an update for this progressive web app has been detected but is
waiting to be activated because a previous version is active. See pwa_update()
to force the update to take place immediately.

## Method Descriptions

JavaScriptObject create_callback(callable: Callable)

Creates a reference to a Callable that can be used as a callback by
JavaScript. The reference must be kept until the callback happens, or it won't
be called at all. See JavaScriptObject for usage.

Note: The callback function must take exactly one Array argument, which is
going to be the JavaScript arguments object converted to an array.

Variant create_object(object: String, ...) vararg

Creates a new JavaScript object using the `new` constructor. The `object` must
a valid property of the JavaScript `window`. See JavaScriptObject for usage.

void download_buffer(buffer: PackedByteArray, name: String, mime: String =
"application/octet-stream")

Prompts the user to download a file containing the specified `buffer`. The
file will have the given `name` and `mime` type.

Note: The browser may override the MIME type provided based on the file
`name`'s extension.

Note: Browsers might block the download if download_buffer() is not being
called from a user interaction (e.g. button click).

Note: Browsers might ask the user for permission or block the download if
multiple download requests are made in a quick succession.

Variant eval(code: String, use_global_execution_context: bool = false)

Execute the string `code` as JavaScript code within the browser window. This
is a call to the actual global JavaScript function `eval()`.

If `use_global_execution_context` is `true`, the code will be evaluated in the
global execution context. Otherwise, it is evaluated in the execution context
of a function within the engine's runtime environment.

void force_fs_sync()

Force synchronization of the persistent file system (when enabled).

Note: This is only useful for modules or extensions that can't use FileAccess
to write files.

JavaScriptObject get_interface(interface: String)

Returns an interface to a JavaScript object that can be used by scripts. The
`interface` must be a valid property of the JavaScript `window`. The callback
must accept a single Array argument, which will contain the JavaScript
`arguments`. See JavaScriptObject for usage.

bool is_js_buffer(javascript_object: JavaScriptObject)

Returns `true` if the given `javascript_object` is of type
[code]ArrayBuffer[/code], [code]DataView[/code], or one of the many typed
array objects.

PackedByteArray js_buffer_to_packed_byte_array(javascript_buffer:
JavaScriptObject)

Returns a copy of `javascript_buffer`'s contents as a PackedByteArray. See
also is_js_buffer().

bool pwa_needs_update() const

Returns `true` if a new version of the progressive web app is waiting to be
activated.

Note: Only relevant when exported as a Progressive Web App.

Error pwa_update()

Performs the live update of the progressive web app. Forcing the new version
to be installed and the page to be reloaded.

Note: Your application will be reloaded in all browser tabs.

Note: Only relevant when exported as a Progressive Web App and
pwa_needs_update() returns `true`.
