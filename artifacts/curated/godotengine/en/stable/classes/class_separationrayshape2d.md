# SeparationRayShape2D

Inherits: Shape2D < Resource < RefCounted < Object

A 2D ray shape used for physics collision that tries to separate itself from
any collider.

## Description

A 2D ray shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape
for a CollisionShape2D. When a SeparationRayShape2D collides with an object,
it tries to separate itself from it by moving its endpoint to the collision
point. For example, a SeparationRayShape2D next to a character can allow it to
instantly move up when touching stairs.

## Properties

float | length | `20.0`  
---|---|---  
bool | slide_on_slope | `false`  
  
## Property Descriptions

float length = `20.0`

  * void set_length(value: float)

  * float get_length()

The ray's length.

bool slide_on_slope = `false`

  * void set_slide_on_slope(value: bool)

  * bool get_slide_on_slope()

If `false` (default), the shape always separates and returns a normal along
its own direction.

If `true`, the shape can return the correct normal and separate in any
direction, allowing sliding motion on slopes.
