# XRAnchor3D

Inherits: XRNode3D < Node3D < Node < Object

An anchor point in AR space.

## Description

The XRAnchor3D point is an XRNode3D that maps a real world location identified
by the AR platform to a position within the game world. For example, as long
as plane detection in ARKit is on, ARKit will identify and update the position
of planes (tables, floors, etc.) and create anchors for them.

This node is mapped to one of the anchors through its unique ID. When you
receive a signal that a new anchor is available, you should add this node to
your scene for that anchor. You can predefine nodes and set the ID; the nodes
will simply remain on 0,0,0 until a plane is recognized.

Keep in mind that, as long as plane detection is enabled, the size, placing
and orientation of an anchor will be updated as the detection logic learns
more about the real world out there especially if only part of the surface is
in view.

## Method Descriptions

Plane get_plane() const

Returns a plane aligned with our anchor; handy for intersection testing.

Vector3 get_size() const

Returns the estimated size of the plane that was detected. Say when the anchor
relates to a table in the real world, this is the estimated size of the
surface of that table.
