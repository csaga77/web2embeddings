# RDFramebufferPass

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Framebuffer pass attachment description (used by RenderingDevice).

## Description

This class contains the list of attachment descriptions for a framebuffer
pass. Each points with an index to a previously supplied list of texture
attachments.

Multipass framebuffers can optimize some configurations in mobile. On desktop,
they provide little to no advantage.

This object is used by RenderingDevice.

## Properties

PackedInt32Array | color_attachments | `PackedInt32Array()`  
---|---|---  
int | depth_attachment | `-1`  
PackedInt32Array | input_attachments | `PackedInt32Array()`  
PackedInt32Array | preserve_attachments | `PackedInt32Array()`  
PackedInt32Array | resolve_attachments | `PackedInt32Array()`  
  
## Constants

ATTACHMENT_UNUSED = `-1`

Attachment is unused.

## Property Descriptions

PackedInt32Array color_attachments = `PackedInt32Array()`

  * void set_color_attachments(value: PackedInt32Array)

  * PackedInt32Array get_color_attachments()

Color attachments in order starting from 0. If this attachment is not used by
the shader, pass ATTACHMENT_UNUSED to skip.

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedInt32Array for more details.

int depth_attachment = `-1`

  * void set_depth_attachment(value: int)

  * int get_depth_attachment()

Depth attachment. ATTACHMENT_UNUSED should be used if no depth buffer is
required for this pass.

PackedInt32Array input_attachments = `PackedInt32Array()`

  * void set_input_attachments(value: PackedInt32Array)

  * PackedInt32Array get_input_attachments()

Used for multipass framebuffers (more than one render pass). Converts an
attachment to an input. Make sure to also supply it properly in the RDUniform
for the uniform set.

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedInt32Array for more details.

PackedInt32Array preserve_attachments = `PackedInt32Array()`

  * void set_preserve_attachments(value: PackedInt32Array)

  * PackedInt32Array get_preserve_attachments()

Attachments to preserve in this pass (otherwise they are erased).

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedInt32Array for more details.

PackedInt32Array resolve_attachments = `PackedInt32Array()`

  * void set_resolve_attachments(value: PackedInt32Array)

  * PackedInt32Array get_resolve_attachments()

If the color attachments are multisampled, non-multisampled resolve
attachments can be provided.

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedInt32Array for more details.
