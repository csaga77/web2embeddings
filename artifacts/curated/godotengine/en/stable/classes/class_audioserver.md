## Signals

bus_layout_changed()

Emitted when an audio bus is added, deleted, or moved.

bus_renamed(bus_index: int, old_name: StringName, new_name: StringName)

Emitted when the audio bus at `bus_index` is renamed from `old_name` to
`new_name`.

## Enumerations

enum SpeakerMode:

SpeakerMode SPEAKER_MODE_STEREO = `0`

Two or fewer speakers were detected.

SpeakerMode SPEAKER_SURROUND_31 = `1`

A 3.1 channel surround setup was detected.

SpeakerMode SPEAKER_SURROUND_51 = `2`

A 5.1 channel surround setup was detected.

SpeakerMode SPEAKER_SURROUND_71 = `3`

A 7.1 channel surround setup was detected.

enum PlaybackType:

PlaybackType PLAYBACK_TYPE_DEFAULT = `0`

Experimental: This constant may be changed or removed in future versions.

The playback will be considered of the type declared at
ProjectSettings.audio/general/default_playback_type.

PlaybackType PLAYBACK_TYPE_STREAM = `1`

Experimental: This constant may be changed or removed in future versions.

Force the playback to be considered as a stream.

PlaybackType PLAYBACK_TYPE_SAMPLE = `2`

Experimental: This constant may be changed or removed in future versions.

Force the playback to be considered as a sample. This can provide lower
latency and more stable playback (with less risk of audio crackling), at the
cost of having less flexibility.

Note: Only currently supported on the web platform.

Note: AudioEffects are not supported when playback is considered as a sample.

PlaybackType PLAYBACK_TYPE_MAX = `3`

Experimental: This constant may be changed or removed in future versions.

Represents the size of the PlaybackType enum.

## Property Descriptions

int bus_count = `1`

  * void set_bus_count(value: int)

  * int get_bus_count()

Number of available audio buses.

String input_device = `"Default"`

  * void set_input_device(value: String)

  * String get_input_device()

Name of the current device for audio input (see get_input_device_list()). On
systems with multiple audio inputs (such as analog, USB and HDMI audio), this
can be used to select the audio input device. The value `"Default"` will
record audio on the system-wide default audio input. If an invalid device name
is set, the value will be reverted back to `"Default"`.

Note: ProjectSettings.audio/driver/enable_input must be `true` for audio input
to work. See also that setting's description for caveats related to
permissions and operating system privacy settings.

String output_device = `"Default"`

  * void set_output_device(value: String)

  * String get_output_device()

Name of the current device for audio output (see get_output_device_list()). On
systems with multiple audio outputs (such as analog, USB and HDMI audio), this
can be used to select the audio output device. The value `"Default"` will play
audio on the system-wide default audio output. If an invalid device name is
set, the value will be reverted back to `"Default"`.

float playback_speed_scale = `1.0`

  * void set_playback_speed_scale(value: float)

  * float get_playback_speed_scale()

Scales the rate at which audio is played (i.e. setting it to `0.5` will make
the audio be played at half its speed). See also Engine.time_scale to affect
the general simulation speed, which is independent from playback_speed_scale.

## Method Descriptions

void add_bus(at_position: int = -1)

Adds a bus at `at_position`.

void add_bus_effect(bus_idx: int, effect: AudioEffect, at_position: int = -1)

Adds an AudioEffect effect to the bus `bus_idx` at `at_position`.

AudioBusLayout generate_bus_layout() const

Generates an AudioBusLayout using the available buses and effects.

int get_bus_channels(bus_idx: int) const

Returns the number of channels of the bus at index `bus_idx`.

AudioEffect get_bus_effect(bus_idx: int, effect_idx: int)

Returns the AudioEffect at position `effect_idx` in bus `bus_idx`.

int get_bus_effect_count(bus_idx: int)

Returns the number of effects on the bus at `bus_idx`.

AudioEffectInstance get_bus_effect_instance(bus_idx: int, effect_idx: int,
channel: int = 0)

Returns the AudioEffectInstance assigned to the given bus and effect indices
(and optionally channel).

int get_bus_index(bus_name: StringName) const

Returns the index of the bus with the name `bus_name`. Returns `-1` if no bus
with the specified name exist.

String get_bus_name(bus_idx: int) const

Returns the name of the bus with the index `bus_idx`.

float get_bus_peak_volume_left_db(bus_idx: int, channel: int) const

Returns the peak volume of the left speaker at bus index `bus_idx` and channel
index `channel`.

float get_bus_peak_volume_right_db(bus_idx: int, channel: int) const

Returns the peak volume of the right speaker at bus index `bus_idx` and
channel index `channel`.

StringName get_bus_send(bus_idx: int) const

Returns the name of the bus that the bus at index `bus_idx` sends to.

float get_bus_volume_db(bus_idx: int) const

Returns the volume of the bus at index `bus_idx` in dB.

float get_bus_volume_linear(bus_idx: int) const

Returns the volume of the bus at index `bus_idx` as a linear value.

Note: The returned value is equivalent to the result of
@GlobalScope.db_to_linear() on the result of get_bus_volume_db().

String get_driver_name() const

Returns the name of the current audio driver. The default usually depends on
the operating system, but may be overridden via the `--audio-driver` command
line argument. `--headless` also automatically sets the audio driver to
`Dummy`. See also ProjectSettings.audio/driver/driver.

PackedStringArray get_input_device_list()

Returns the names of all audio input devices detected on the system.

Note: ProjectSettings.audio/driver/enable_input must be `true` for audio input
to work. See also that setting's description for caveats related to
permissions and operating system privacy settings.

float get_input_mix_rate() const

Returns the sample rate at the input of the AudioServer.

float get_mix_rate() const

Returns the sample rate at the output of the AudioServer.

PackedStringArray get_output_device_list()

Returns the names of all audio output devices detected on the system.

float get_output_latency() const

Returns the audio driver's effective output latency. This is based on
ProjectSettings.audio/driver/output_latency, but the exact returned value will
differ depending on the operating system and audio driver.

Note: This can be expensive; it is not recommended to call
get_output_latency() every frame.

SpeakerMode get_speaker_mode() const

Returns the speaker configuration.

float get_time_since_last_mix() const

Returns the relative time since the last mix occurred.

float get_time_to_next_mix() const

Returns the relative time until the next mix occurs.

bool is_bus_bypassing_effects(bus_idx: int) const

If `true`, the bus at index `bus_idx` is bypassing effects.

bool is_bus_effect_enabled(bus_idx: int, effect_idx: int) const

If `true`, the effect at index `effect_idx` on the bus at index `bus_idx` is
enabled.

bool is_bus_mute(bus_idx: int) const

If `true`, the bus at index `bus_idx` is muted.

bool is_bus_solo(bus_idx: int) const

If `true`, the bus at index `bus_idx` is in solo mode.

bool is_stream_registered_as_sample(stream: AudioStream)

Experimental: This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

If `true`, the stream is registered as a sample. The engine will not have to
register it before playing the sample.

If `false`, the stream will have to be registered before playing it. To
prevent lag spikes, register the stream as sample with
register_stream_as_sample().

void lock()

Locks the audio driver's main loop.

Note: Remember to unlock it afterwards.

void move_bus(index: int, to_index: int)

Moves the bus from index `index` to index `to_index`.

void register_stream_as_sample(stream: AudioStream)

Experimental: This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Forces the registration of a stream as a sample.

Note: Lag spikes may occur when calling this method, especially on single-
threaded builds. It is suggested to call this method while loading assets,
where the lag spike could be masked, instead of registering the sample right
before it needs to be played.

void remove_bus(index: int)

Removes the bus at index `index`.

void remove_bus_effect(bus_idx: int, effect_idx: int)

Removes the effect at index `effect_idx` from the bus at index `bus_idx`.

void set_bus_bypass_effects(bus_idx: int, enable: bool)

If `true`, the bus at index `bus_idx` is bypassing effects.

void set_bus_effect_enabled(bus_idx: int, effect_idx: int, enabled: bool)

If `true`, the effect at index `effect_idx` on the bus at index `bus_idx` is
enabled.

void set_bus_layout(bus_layout: AudioBusLayout)

Overwrites the currently used AudioBusLayout.

void set_bus_mute(bus_idx: int, enable: bool)

If `true`, the bus at index `bus_idx` is muted.

void set_bus_name(bus_idx: int, name: String)

Sets the name of the bus at index `bus_idx` to `name`.

void set_bus_send(bus_idx: int, send: StringName)

Connects the output of the bus at `bus_idx` to the bus named `send`.

void set_bus_solo(bus_idx: int, enable: bool)

If `true`, the bus at index `bus_idx` is in solo mode.

void set_bus_volume_db(bus_idx: int, volume_db: float)

Sets the volume in decibels of the bus at index `bus_idx` to `volume_db`.

void set_bus_volume_linear(bus_idx: int, volume_linear: float)

Sets the volume as a linear value of the bus at index `bus_idx` to
`volume_linear`.

Note: Using this method is equivalent to calling set_bus_volume_db() with the
result of @GlobalScope.linear_to_db() on a value.

void set_enable_tagging_used_audio_streams(enable: bool)

If set to `true`, all instances of AudioStreamPlayback will call
AudioStreamPlayback._tag_used_streams() every mix step.

Note: This is enabled by default in the editor, as it is used by editor
plugins for the audio stream previews.

void swap_bus_effects(bus_idx: int, effect_idx: int, by_effect_idx: int)

Swaps the position of two effects in bus `bus_idx`.

void unlock()

Unlocks the audio driver's main loop. (After locking it, you should always
unlock it.)
