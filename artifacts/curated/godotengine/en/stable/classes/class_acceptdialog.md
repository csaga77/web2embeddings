# AcceptDialog

Inherits: Window < Viewport < Node < Object

Inherited By: ConfirmationDialog

A base dialog used for user notification.

## Description

The default use of AcceptDialog is to allow it to only be accepted or closed,
with the same result. However, the confirmed and canceled signals allow to
make the two actions different, and the add_button() method allows to add
custom buttons and actions.

## Signals

canceled()

Emitted when the dialog is closed or the button created with
add_cancel_button() is pressed.

confirmed()

Emitted when the dialog is accepted, i.e. the OK button is pressed.

custom_action(action: StringName)

Emitted when a custom button is pressed. See add_button().

## Property Descriptions

bool dialog_autowrap = `false`

  * void set_autowrap(value: bool)

  * bool has_autowrap()

Sets autowrapping for the text in the dialog.

bool dialog_close_on_escape = `true`

  * void set_close_on_escape(value: bool)

  * bool get_close_on_escape()

If `true`, the dialog will be hidden when the escape key
(@GlobalScope.KEY_ESCAPE) is pressed.

bool dialog_hide_on_ok = `true`

  * void set_hide_on_ok(value: bool)

  * bool get_hide_on_ok()

If `true`, the dialog is hidden when the OK button is pressed. You can set it
to `false` if you want to do e.g. input validation when receiving the
confirmed signal, and handle hiding the dialog in your own logic.

Note: Some nodes derived from this class can have a different default value,
and potentially their own built-in logic overriding this setting. For example
FileDialog defaults to `false`, and has its own input validation code that is
called when you press OK, which eventually hides the dialog if the input is
valid. As such, this property can't be used in FileDialog to disable hiding
the dialog when pressing OK.

String dialog_text = `""`

  * void set_text(value: String)

  * String get_text()

The text displayed by the dialog.

String ok_button_text = `"OK"`

  * void set_ok_button_text(value: String)

  * String get_ok_button_text()

The text displayed by the OK button (see get_ok_button()).

## Method Descriptions

Button add_button(text: String, right: bool = false, action: String = "")

Adds a button with label `text` and a custom `action` to the dialog and
returns the created button. `action` will be passed to the custom_action
signal when pressed.

If `true`, `right` will place the button to the right of any sibling buttons.

You can use remove_button() method to remove a button created with this method
from the dialog.

Button add_cancel_button(name: String)

Adds a button with label `name` and a cancel action to the dialog and returns
the created button.

You can use remove_button() method to remove a button created with this method
from the dialog.

Label get_label()

Returns the label used for built-in text.

Warning: This is a required internal node, removing and freeing it may cause a
crash. If you wish to hide it or any of its children, use their
CanvasItem.visible property.

Button get_ok_button()

Returns the OK Button instance.

Warning: This is a required internal node, removing and freeing it may cause a
crash. If you wish to hide it or any of its children, use their
CanvasItem.visible property.

void register_text_enter(line_edit: LineEdit)

Registers a LineEdit in the dialog. When the enter key is pressed, the dialog
will be accepted.

void remove_button(button: Button)

Removes the `button` from the dialog. Does NOT free the `button`. The `button`
must be a Button added with add_button() or add_cancel_button() method. After
removal, pressing the `button` will no longer emit this dialog's custom_action
or canceled signals.

## Theme Property Descriptions

int buttons_min_height = `0`

The minimum height of each button in the bottom row (such as OK/Cancel) in
pixels. This can be increased to make buttons with short texts easier to
click/tap.

int buttons_min_width = `0`

The minimum width of each button in the bottom row (such as OK/Cancel) in
pixels. This can be increased to make buttons with short texts easier to
click/tap.

int buttons_separation = `10`

The size of the vertical space between the dialog's content and the button
row.

StyleBox panel

The panel that fills the background of the window.
