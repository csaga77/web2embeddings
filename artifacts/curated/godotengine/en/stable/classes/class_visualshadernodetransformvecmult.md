# VisualShaderNodeTransformVecMult

Inherits: VisualShaderNode < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Multiplies a Transform3D and a Vector3 within the visual shader graph.

## Description

A multiplication operation on a transform (44 matrix) and a vector, with
support for different multiplication operators.

## Properties

Operator | operator | `0`  
---|---|---  
  
## Enumerations

enum Operator:

Operator OP_AxB = `0`

Multiplies transform `a` by the vector `b`.

Operator OP_BxA = `1`

Multiplies vector `b` by the transform `a`.

Operator OP_3x3_AxB = `2`

Multiplies transform `a` by the vector `b`, skipping the last row and column
of the transform.

Operator OP_3x3_BxA = `3`

Multiplies vector `b` by the transform `a`, skipping the last row and column
of the transform.

Operator OP_MAX = `4`

Represents the size of the Operator enum.

## Property Descriptions
