# VisualShaderNodeVectorOp

Inherits: VisualShaderNodeVectorBase < VisualShaderNode < Resource <
RefCounted < Object

A vector operator to be used within the visual shader graph.

## Description

A visual shader node for use of vector operators. Operates on vector `a` and
vector `b`.

## Properties

Operator | operator | `0`  
---|---|---  
  
## Enumerations

enum Operator:

Operator OP_ADD = `0`

Adds two vectors.

Operator OP_SUB = `1`

Subtracts a vector from a vector.

Operator OP_MUL = `2`

Multiplies two vectors.

Operator OP_DIV = `3`

Divides vector by vector.

Operator OP_MOD = `4`

Returns the remainder of the two vectors.

Operator OP_POW = `5`

Returns the value of the first parameter raised to the power of the second,
for each component of the vectors.

Operator OP_MAX = `6`

Returns the greater of two values, for each component of the vectors.

Operator OP_MIN = `7`

Returns the lesser of two values, for each component of the vectors.

Operator OP_CROSS = `8`

Calculates the cross product of two vectors.

Operator OP_ATAN2 = `9`

Returns the arc-tangent of the parameters.

Operator OP_REFLECT = `10`

Returns the vector that points in the direction of reflection. `a` is incident
vector and `b` is the normal vector.

Operator OP_STEP = `11`

Vector step operator. Returns `0.0` if `a` is smaller than `b` and `1.0`
otherwise.

Operator OP_ENUM_SIZE = `12`

Represents the size of the Operator enum.
