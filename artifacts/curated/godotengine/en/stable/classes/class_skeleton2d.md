# Skeleton2D

Inherits: Node2D < CanvasItem < Node < Object

The parent of a hierarchy of Bone2Ds, used to create a 2D skeletal animation.

## Description

Skeleton2D parents a hierarchy of Bone2D nodes. It holds a reference to each
Bone2D's rest pose and acts as a single point of access to its bones.

To set up different types of inverse kinematics for the given Skeleton2D, a
SkeletonModificationStack2D should be created. The inverse kinematics be
applied by increasing SkeletonModificationStack2D.modification_count and
creating the desired number of modifications.

## Signals

bone_setup_changed()

Emitted when the Bone2D setup attached to this skeletons changes. This is
primarily used internally within the skeleton.

## Method Descriptions

void execute_modifications(delta: float, execution_mode: int)

Executes all the modifications on the SkeletonModificationStack2D, if the
Skeleton2D has one assigned.

Bone2D get_bone(idx: int)

Returns a Bone2D from the node hierarchy parented by Skeleton2D. The object to
return is identified by the parameter `idx`. Bones are indexed by descending
the node hierarchy from top to bottom, adding the children of each branch
before moving to the next sibling.

int get_bone_count() const

Returns the number of Bone2D nodes in the node hierarchy parented by
Skeleton2D.

Transform2D get_bone_local_pose_override(bone_idx: int)

Returns the local pose override transform for `bone_idx`.

SkeletonModificationStack2D get_modification_stack() const

Returns the SkeletonModificationStack2D attached to this skeleton, if one
exists.

RID get_skeleton() const

Returns the RID of a Skeleton2D instance.

void set_bone_local_pose_override(bone_idx: int, override_pose: Transform2D,
strength: float, persistent: bool)

Sets the local pose transform, `override_pose`, for the bone at `bone_idx`.

`strength` is the interpolation strength that will be used when applying the
pose, and `persistent` determines if the applied pose will remain.

Note: The pose transform needs to be a local transform relative to the Bone2D
node at `bone_idx`!

void set_modification_stack(modification_stack: SkeletonModificationStack2D)

Sets the SkeletonModificationStack2D attached to this skeleton.
