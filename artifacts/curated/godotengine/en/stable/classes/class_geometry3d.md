## Method Descriptions

Array[Plane] build_box_planes(extents: Vector3)

Returns an array with 6 Planes that describe the sides of a box centered at
the origin. The box size is defined by `extents`, which represents one
(positive) corner of the box (i.e. half its actual size).

Array[Plane] build_capsule_planes(radius: float, height: float, sides: int,
lats: int, axis: Axis = 2)

Returns an array of Planes closely bounding a faceted capsule centered at the
origin with radius `radius` and height `height`. The parameter `sides` defines
how many planes will be generated for the side part of the capsule, whereas
`lats` gives the number of latitudinal steps at the bottom and top of the
capsule. The parameter `axis` describes the axis along which the capsule is
oriented (0 for X, 1 for Y, 2 for Z).

Array[Plane] build_cylinder_planes(radius: float, height: float, sides: int,
axis: Axis = 2)

Returns an array of Planes closely bounding a faceted cylinder centered at the
origin with radius `radius` and height `height`. The parameter `sides` defines
how many planes will be generated for the round part of the cylinder. The
parameter `axis` describes the axis along which the cylinder is oriented (0
for X, 1 for Y, 2 for Z).

PackedVector3Array clip_polygon(points: PackedVector3Array, plane: Plane)

Clips the polygon defined by the points in `points` against the `plane` and
returns the points of the clipped polygon.

PackedVector3Array compute_convex_mesh_points(planes: Array[Plane])

Calculates and returns all the vertex points of a convex shape defined by an
array of `planes`.

Vector3 get_closest_point_to_segment(point: Vector3, s1: Vector3, s2: Vector3)

Returns the 3D point on the 3D segment (`s1`, `s2`) that is closest to
`point`. The returned point will always be inside the specified segment.

Vector3 get_closest_point_to_segment_uncapped(point: Vector3, s1: Vector3, s2:
Vector3)

Returns the 3D point on the 3D line defined by (`s1`, `s2`) that is closest to
`point`. The returned point can be inside the segment (`s1`, `s2`) or outside
of it, i.e. somewhere on the line extending from the segment.

PackedVector3Array get_closest_points_between_segments(p1: Vector3, p2:
Vector3, q1: Vector3, q2: Vector3)

Given the two 3D segments (`p1`, `p2`) and (`q1`, `q2`), finds those two
points on the two segments that are closest to each other. Returns a
PackedVector3Array that contains this point on (`p1`, `p2`) as well the
accompanying point on (`q1`, `q2`).

Vector3 get_triangle_barycentric_coords(point: Vector3, a: Vector3, b:
Vector3, c: Vector3)

Returns a Vector3 containing weights based on how close a 3D position
(`point`) is to a triangle's different vertices (`a`, `b` and `c`). This is
useful for interpolating between the data of different vertices in a triangle.
One example use case is using this to smoothly rotate over a mesh instead of
relying solely on face normals.

Here is a more detailed explanation of barycentric coordinates.

Variant ray_intersects_triangle(from: Vector3, dir: Vector3, a: Vector3, b:
Vector3, c: Vector3)

Tests if the 3D ray starting at `from` with the direction of `dir` intersects
the triangle specified by `a`, `b` and `c`. If yes, returns the point of
intersection as Vector3. If no intersection takes place, returns `null`.

PackedVector3Array segment_intersects_convex(from: Vector3, to: Vector3,
planes: Array[Plane])

Given a convex hull defined though the Planes in the array `planes`, tests if
the segment (`from`, `to`) intersects with that hull. If an intersection is
found, returns a PackedVector3Array containing the point the intersection and
the hull's normal. Otherwise, returns an empty array.

PackedVector3Array segment_intersects_cylinder(from: Vector3, to: Vector3,
height: float, radius: float)

Checks if the segment (`from`, `to`) intersects the cylinder with height
`height` that is centered at the origin and has radius `radius`. If no,
returns an empty PackedVector3Array. If an intersection takes place, the
returned array contains the point of intersection and the cylinder's normal at
the point of intersection.

PackedVector3Array segment_intersects_sphere(from: Vector3, to: Vector3,
sphere_position: Vector3, sphere_radius: float)

Checks if the segment (`from`, `to`) intersects the sphere that is located at
`sphere_position` and has radius `sphere_radius`. If no, returns an empty
PackedVector3Array. If yes, returns a PackedVector3Array containing the point
of intersection and the sphere's normal at the point of intersection.

Variant segment_intersects_triangle(from: Vector3, to: Vector3, a: Vector3, b:
Vector3, c: Vector3)

Tests if the segment (`from`, `to`) intersects the triangle `a`, `b`, `c`. If
yes, returns the point of intersection as Vector3. If no intersection takes
place, returns `null`.

PackedInt32Array tetrahedralize_delaunay(points: PackedVector3Array)

Tetrahedralizes the volume specified by a discrete set of `points` in 3D
space, ensuring that no point lies within the circumsphere of any resulting
tetrahedron. The method returns a PackedInt32Array where each tetrahedron
consists of four consecutive point indices into the `points` array (resulting
in an array with `n * 4` elements, where `n` is the number of tetrahedra
found). If the tetrahedralization is unsuccessful, an empty PackedInt32Array
is returned.
