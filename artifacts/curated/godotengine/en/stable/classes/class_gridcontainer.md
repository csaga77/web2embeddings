# GridContainer

Inherits: Container < Control < CanvasItem < Node < Object

A container that arranges its child controls in a grid layout.

## Description

GridContainer arranges its child controls in a grid layout. The number of
columns is specified by the columns property, whereas the number of rows
depends on how many are needed for the child controls. The number of rows and
columns is preserved for every size of the container.

Note: GridContainer only works with child nodes inheriting from Control. It
won't rearrange child nodes inheriting from Node2D.
