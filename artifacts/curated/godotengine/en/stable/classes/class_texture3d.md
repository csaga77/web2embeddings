# Texture3D

Inherits: Texture < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Inherited By: CompressedTexture3D, ImageTexture3D, NoiseTexture3D,
PlaceholderTexture3D, Texture3DRD

Base class for 3-dimensional textures.

## Description

Base class for ImageTexture3D and CompressedTexture3D. Cannot be used
directly, but contains all the functions necessary for accessing the derived
resource types. Texture3D is the base class for all 3-dimensional texture
types. See also TextureLayered.

All images need to have the same width, height and number of mipmap levels.

To create such a texture file yourself, reimport your image files using the
Godot Editor import presets.

## Method Descriptions

Array[Image] _get_data() virtual const

Called when the Texture3D's data is queried.

int _get_depth() virtual const

Called when the Texture3D's depth is queried.

Format _get_format() virtual const

Called when the Texture3D's format is queried.

int _get_height() virtual const

Called when the Texture3D's height is queried.

int _get_width() virtual const

Called when the Texture3D's width is queried.

bool _has_mipmaps() virtual const

Called when the presence of mipmaps in the Texture3D is queried.

Resource create_placeholder() const

Creates a placeholder version of this resource (PlaceholderTexture3D).

Array[Image] get_data() const

Returns the Texture3D's data as an array of Images. Each Image represents a
slice of the Texture3D, with different slices mapping to different depth (Z
axis) levels.

int get_depth() const

Returns the Texture3D's depth in pixels. Depth is typically represented by the
Z axis (a dimension not present in Texture2D).

Format get_format() const

Returns the current format being used by this texture. See Format for details.

int get_height() const

Returns the Texture3D's height in pixels. Width is typically represented by
the Y axis.

int get_width() const

Returns the Texture3D's width in pixels. Width is typically represented by the
X axis.

bool has_mipmaps() const

Returns `true` if the Texture3D has generated mipmaps.
