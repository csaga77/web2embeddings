# Window

Inherits: Viewport < Node < Object

Inherited By: AcceptDialog, Popup

Base class for all windows, dialogs, and popups.

## Description

A node that creates a window. The window can either be a native system window
or embedded inside another Window (see Viewport.gui_embed_subwindows).

At runtime, Windows will not close automatically when requested. You need to
handle it manually using the close_requested signal (this applies both to
pressing the close button and clicking outside of a popup).

## Signals

about_to_popup()

Emitted right after popup() call, before the Window appears or does anything.

close_requested()

Emitted when the Window's close button is pressed or when popup_window is
enabled and user clicks outside the window.

This signal can be used to handle window closing, e.g. by connecting it to
hide().

dpi_changed()

Emitted when the Window's DPI changes as a result of OS-level changes (e.g.
moving the window from a Retina display to a lower resolution one).

Note: Only implemented on macOS.

files_dropped(files: PackedStringArray)

Emitted when files are dragged from the OS file manager and dropped in the
game window. The argument is a list of file paths.

    
    
    func _ready():
        get_window().files_dropped.connect(on_files_dropped)
    
    func on_files_dropped(files):
        print(files)
    

Note: This signal only works with native windows, i.e. the main window and
Window-derived nodes when Viewport.gui_embed_subwindows is disabled in the
main viewport.

focus_entered()

Emitted when the Window gains focus.

focus_exited()

Emitted when the Window loses its focus.

go_back_requested()

Emitted when a go back request is sent (e.g. pressing the "Back" button on
Android), right after Node.NOTIFICATION_WM_GO_BACK_REQUEST.

mouse_entered()

Emitted when the mouse cursor enters the Window's visible area, that is not
occluded behind other Controls or windows, provided its
Viewport.gui_disable_input is `false` and regardless if it's currently focused
or not.

mouse_exited()

Emitted when the mouse cursor leaves the Window's visible area, that is not
occluded behind other Controls or windows, provided its
Viewport.gui_disable_input is `false` and regardless if it's currently focused
or not.

theme_changed()

Emitted when the NOTIFICATION_THEME_CHANGED notification is sent.

title_changed()

Emitted when window title bar text is changed.

titlebar_changed()

Emitted when window title bar decorations are changed, e.g. macOS window
enter/exit full screen mode, or extend-to-title flag is changed.

visibility_changed()

Emitted when Window is made visible or disappears.

window_input(event: InputEvent)

Emitted when the Window is currently focused and receives any input, passing
the received event as an argument. The event's position, if present, is in the
embedder's coordinate system.

## Enumerations

enum Mode:

Mode MODE_WINDOWED = `0`

Windowed mode, i.e. Window doesn't occupy the whole screen (unless set to the
size of the screen).

Mode MODE_MINIMIZED = `1`

Minimized window mode, i.e. Window is not visible and available on window
manager's window list. Normally happens when the minimize button is pressed.

Mode MODE_MAXIMIZED = `2`

Maximized window mode, i.e. Window will occupy whole screen area except task
bar and still display its borders. Normally happens when the maximize button
is pressed.

Mode MODE_FULLSCREEN = `3`

Full screen mode with full multi-window support.

Full screen window covers the entire display area of a screen and has no
decorations. The display's video mode is not changed.

On Android: This enables immersive mode.

On Windows: Multi-window full-screen mode has a 1px border of the
ProjectSettings.rendering/environment/defaults/default_clear_color color.

On macOS: A new desktop is used to display the running project.

Note: Regardless of the platform, enabling full screen will change the window
size to match the monitor's size. Therefore, make sure your project supports
multiple resolutions when enabling full screen mode.

Mode MODE_EXCLUSIVE_FULLSCREEN = `4`

A single window full screen mode. This mode has less overhead, but only one
window can be open on a given screen at a time (opening a child window or
application switching will trigger a full screen transition).

Full screen window covers the entire display area of a screen and has no
border or decorations. The display's video mode is not changed.

On Android: This enables immersive mode.

On Windows: Depending on video driver, full screen transition might cause
screens to go black for a moment.

On macOS: A new desktop is used to display the running project. Exclusive full
screen mode prevents Dock and Menu from showing up when the mouse pointer is
hovering the edge of the screen.

On Linux (X11): Exclusive full screen mode bypasses compositor.

Note: Regardless of the platform, enabling full screen will change the window
size to match the monitor's size. Therefore, make sure your project supports
multiple resolutions when enabling full screen mode.

enum Flags:

Flags FLAG_RESIZE_DISABLED = `0`

The window can't be resized by dragging its resize grip. It's still possible
to resize the window using size. This flag is ignored for full screen windows.
Set with unresizable.

Flags FLAG_BORDERLESS = `1`

The window do not have native title bar and other decorations. This flag is
ignored for full-screen windows. Set with borderless.

Flags FLAG_ALWAYS_ON_TOP = `2`

The window is floating on top of all other windows. This flag is ignored for
full-screen windows. Set with always_on_top.

Flags FLAG_TRANSPARENT = `3`

The window background can be transparent. Set with transparent.

Note: This flag has no effect if either
ProjectSettings.display/window/per_pixel_transparency/allowed, or the window's
Viewport.transparent_bg is set to `false`.

Flags FLAG_NO_FOCUS = `4`

The window can't be focused. No-focus window will ignore all input, except
mouse clicks. Set with unfocusable.

Flags FLAG_POPUP = `5`

Window is part of menu or OptionButton dropdown. This flag can't be changed
when the window is visible. An active popup window will exclusively receive
all input, without stealing focus from its parent. Popup windows are
automatically closed when uses click outside it, or when an application is
switched. Popup window must have transient parent set (see transient).

Note: This flag has no effect in embedded windows (unless said window is a
Popup).

Flags FLAG_EXTEND_TO_TITLE = `6`

Window content is expanded to the full size of the window. Unlike borderless
window, the frame is left intact and can be used to resize the window, title
bar is transparent, but have minimize/maximize/close buttons. Set with
extend_to_title.

Note: This flag is implemented only on macOS.

Note: This flag has no effect in embedded windows.

Flags FLAG_MOUSE_PASSTHROUGH = `7`

All mouse events are passed to the underlying window of the same application.

Note: This flag has no effect in embedded windows.

Flags FLAG_SHARP_CORNERS = `8`

Window style is overridden, forcing sharp corners.

Note: This flag has no effect in embedded windows.

Note: This flag is implemented only on Windows (11).

Flags FLAG_EXCLUDE_FROM_CAPTURE = `9`

Windows is excluded from screenshots taken by
DisplayServer.screen_get_image(), DisplayServer.screen_get_image_rect(), and
DisplayServer.screen_get_pixel().

Note: This flag is implemented on macOS and Windows.

Note: Setting this flag will NOT prevent other apps from capturing an image,
it should not be used as a security measure.

Flags FLAG_MAX = `10`

Max value of the Flags.

enum ContentScaleMode:

ContentScaleMode CONTENT_SCALE_MODE_DISABLED = `0`

The content will not be scaled to match the Window's size.

ContentScaleMode CONTENT_SCALE_MODE_CANVAS_ITEMS = `1`

The content will be rendered at the target size. This is more performance-
expensive than CONTENT_SCALE_MODE_VIEWPORT, but provides better results.

ContentScaleMode CONTENT_SCALE_MODE_VIEWPORT = `2`

The content will be rendered at the base size and then scaled to the target
size. More performant than CONTENT_SCALE_MODE_CANVAS_ITEMS, but results in
pixelated image.

enum ContentScaleAspect:

ContentScaleAspect CONTENT_SCALE_ASPECT_IGNORE = `0`

The aspect will be ignored. Scaling will simply stretch the content to fit the
target size.

ContentScaleAspect CONTENT_SCALE_ASPECT_KEEP = `1`

The content's aspect will be preserved. If the target size has different
aspect from the base one, the image will be centered and black bars will
appear on left and right sides.

ContentScaleAspect CONTENT_SCALE_ASPECT_KEEP_WIDTH = `2`

The content can be expanded vertically. Scaling horizontally will result in
keeping the width ratio and then black bars on left and right sides.

ContentScaleAspect CONTENT_SCALE_ASPECT_KEEP_HEIGHT = `3`

The content can be expanded horizontally. Scaling vertically will result in
keeping the height ratio and then black bars on top and bottom sides.

ContentScaleAspect CONTENT_SCALE_ASPECT_EXPAND = `4`

The content's aspect will be preserved. If the target size has different
aspect from the base one, the content will stay in the top-left corner and add
an extra visible area in the stretched space.

enum ContentScaleStretch:

ContentScaleStretch CONTENT_SCALE_STRETCH_FRACTIONAL = `0`

The content will be stretched according to a fractional factor. This fills all
the space available in the window, but allows "pixel wobble" to occur due to
uneven pixel scaling.

ContentScaleStretch CONTENT_SCALE_STRETCH_INTEGER = `1`

The content will be stretched only according to an integer factor, preserving
sharp pixels. This may leave a black background visible on the window's edges
depending on the window size.

enum LayoutDirection:

LayoutDirection LAYOUT_DIRECTION_INHERITED = `0`

Automatic layout direction, determined from the parent window layout
direction.

LayoutDirection LAYOUT_DIRECTION_APPLICATION_LOCALE = `1`

Automatic layout direction, determined from the current locale.

LayoutDirection LAYOUT_DIRECTION_LTR = `2`

Left-to-right layout direction.

LayoutDirection LAYOUT_DIRECTION_RTL = `3`

Right-to-left layout direction.

LayoutDirection LAYOUT_DIRECTION_SYSTEM_LOCALE = `4`

Automatic layout direction, determined from the system locale.

LayoutDirection LAYOUT_DIRECTION_MAX = `5`

Represents the size of the LayoutDirection enum.

LayoutDirection LAYOUT_DIRECTION_LOCALE = `1`

Deprecated: Use LAYOUT_DIRECTION_APPLICATION_LOCALE instead.

enum WindowInitialPosition:

WindowInitialPosition WINDOW_INITIAL_POSITION_ABSOLUTE = `0`

Initial window position is determined by position.

WindowInitialPosition WINDOW_INITIAL_POSITION_CENTER_PRIMARY_SCREEN = `1`

Initial window position is the center of the primary screen.

WindowInitialPosition WINDOW_INITIAL_POSITION_CENTER_MAIN_WINDOW_SCREEN = `2`

Initial window position is the center of the main window screen.

WindowInitialPosition WINDOW_INITIAL_POSITION_CENTER_OTHER_SCREEN = `3`

Initial window position is the center of current_screen screen.

WindowInitialPosition WINDOW_INITIAL_POSITION_CENTER_SCREEN_WITH_MOUSE_FOCUS =
`4`

Initial window position is the center of the screen containing the mouse
pointer.

WindowInitialPosition
WINDOW_INITIAL_POSITION_CENTER_SCREEN_WITH_KEYBOARD_FOCUS = `5`

Initial window position is the center of the screen containing the window with
the keyboard focus.

## Constants

NOTIFICATION_VISIBILITY_CHANGED = `30`

Emitted when Window's visibility changes, right before visibility_changed.

NOTIFICATION_THEME_CHANGED = `32`

Sent when the node needs to refresh its theme items. This happens in one of
the following cases:

  * The theme property is changed on this node or any of its ancestors.

  * The theme_type_variation property is changed on this node.

  * The node enters the scene tree.

Note: As an optimization, this notification won't be sent from changes that
occur while this node is outside of the scene tree. Instead, all of the theme
item updates can be applied at once when the node enters the scene tree.

## Property Descriptions

bool always_on_top = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enabled: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, the window will be on top of all other windows. Does not work if
transient is enabled.

scale factor determined by content_scale_size.

int current_screen

  * void set_current_screen(value: int)

  * int get_current_screen()

The screen the window is currently on.

bool exclude_from_capture = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enabled: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

DisplayServer.screen_get_image(), DisplayServer.screen_get_image_rect(), and
DisplayServer.screen_get_pixel().

bool exclusive = `false`

  * void set_exclusive(value: bool)

  * bool is_exclusive()

If `true`, the Window will be in exclusive mode. Exclusive windows are always
on top of their parent and will block all input going to the parent Window.

Needs transient enabled to work.

bool extend_to_title = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enabled: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, the Window contents is expanded to the full size of the window,
window title bar is transparent.

Note: This property is implemented only on macOS.

Note: This property only works with native windows.

bool force_native = `false`

  * void set_force_native(value: bool)

If `true`, the Window width is expanded to keep the title bar text fully
visible.

Vector2i max_size = `Vector2i(0, 0)`

  * void set_max_size(value: Vector2i)

  * Vector2i get_max_size()

If non-zero, the Window can't be resized to be bigger than this size.

Note: This property will be ignored if the value is lower than min_size.

Vector2i min_size = `Vector2i(0, 0)`

  * void set_min_size(value: Vector2i)

  * Vector2i get_min_size()

If non-zero, the Window can't be resized to be smaller than this size.

Note: This property will be ignored in favor of get_contents_minimum_size() if
wrap_controls is enabled and if its size is bigger.

Mode mode = `0`

  * void set_mode(value: Mode)

  * Mode get_mode()

Set's the window's current mode.

Note: Fullscreen mode is not exclusive full screen on Windows and Linux.

Note: This method only works with native windows, i.e. the main window and
Window-derived nodes when Viewport.gui_embed_subwindows is disabled in the
main viewport.

bool mouse_passthrough = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enabled: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, all mouse events will be passed to the underlying window of the
same application. See also mouse_passthrough_polygon.

Note: This property is implemented on Linux (X11), macOS and Windows.

Note: This property only works with native windows.

PackedVector2Array mouse_passthrough_polygon = `PackedVector2Array()`

  * void set_mouse_passthrough_polygon(value: PackedVector2Array)

  * PackedVector2Array get_mouse_passthrough_polygon()

Sets a polygonal region of the window which accepts mouse events. Mouse events
outside the region will be passed through.

Passing an empty array will disable passthrough support (all mouse events will
be intercepted by the window, which is the default behavior).

GDScriptC#

    
    
    # Set region, using Path2D node.
    $Window.mouse_passthrough_polygon = $Path2D.curve.get_baked_points()
    
    # Set region, using Polygon2D node.
    $Window.mouse_passthrough_polygon = $Polygon2D.polygon
    
    # Reset region to default.
    $Window.mouse_passthrough_polygon = []
    
    
    
    // Set region, using Path2D node.
    GetNode<Window>("Window").MousePassthroughPolygon = GetNode<Path2D>("Path2D").Curve.GetBakedPoints();
    
    // Set region, using Polygon2D node.
    GetNode<Window>("Window").MousePassthroughPolygon = GetNode<Polygon2D>("Polygon2D").Polygon;
    
    // Reset region to default.
    GetNode<Window>("Window").MousePassthroughPolygon = [];
    

Note: This property is ignored if mouse_passthrough is set to `true`.

Note: On Windows, the portion of a window that lies outside the region is not
drawn, while on Linux (X11) and macOS it is.

Note: This property is implemented on Linux (X11), macOS and Windows.

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedVector2Array for more details.

bool popup_window = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enabled: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, the Window will be considered a popup. Popups are sub-windows that
don't show as separate windows in system's window manager's window list and
will send close request when anything is clicked outside of them (unless
exclusive is enabled).

Vector2i position = `Vector2i(0, 0)`

  * void set_position(value: Vector2i)

  * Vector2i get_position()

The window's position in pixels.

If ProjectSettings.display/window/subwindows/embed_subwindows is `false`, the
position is in absolute screen coordinates. This typically applies to editor
plugins. If the setting is `true`, the window's position is in the coordinates
of its parent Viewport.

Note: This property only works if initial_position is set to
WINDOW_INITIAL_POSITION_ABSOLUTE.

bool sharp_corners = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enabled: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, the Window will override the OS window style to display sharp
corners.

Note: This property is implemented only on Windows (11).

Note: This property only works with native windows.

Vector2i size = `Vector2i(100, 100)`

  * void set_size(value: Vector2i)

  * Vector2i get_size()

The window's size in pixels.

Theme theme

  * void set_theme(value: Theme)

  * Theme get_theme()

The Theme resource this node and all its Control and Window children use. If a
child node has its own Theme resource set, theme items are merged with child's
definitions having higher priority.

Note: Window styles will have no effect unless the window is embedded.

StringName theme_type_variation = `&""`

  * void set_theme_type_variation(value: StringName)

  * StringName get_theme_type_variation()

The name of a theme type variation used by this Window to look up its own
theme items. See Control.theme_type_variation for more details.

String title = `""`

  * void set_title(value: String)

  * String get_title()

The window's title. If the Window is native, title styles set in Theme will
have no effect.

bool transient = `false`

  * void set_transient(value: bool)

  * bool is_transient()

If `true`, the Window is transient, i.e. it's considered a child of another
Window. The transient window will be destroyed with its transient parent and
will return focus to their parent when closed. The transient window is
displayed on top of a non-exclusive full-screen parent window. Transient
windows can't enter full-screen mode.

Note that behavior might be different depending on the platform.

bool transient_to_focused = `false`

  * void set_transient_to_focused(value: bool)

  * bool is_transient_to_focused()

If `true`, and the Window is transient, this window will (at the time of
becoming visible) become transient to the currently focused window instead of
the immediate parent window in the hierarchy. Note that the transient parent
is assigned at the time this window becomes visible, so changing it afterwards
has no effect until re-shown.

bool transparent = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enabled: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, the Window's background can be transparent. This is best used with
embedded windows.

Note: Transparency support is implemented on Linux, macOS and Windows, but
availability might vary depending on GPU driver, display manager, and
compositor capabilities.

Note: This property has no effect if
ProjectSettings.display/window/per_pixel_transparency/allowed is set to
`false`.

bool unfocusable = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enabled: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, the Window can't be focused nor interacted with. It can still be
visible.

bool unresizable = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enabled: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, the window can't be resized. Minimize and maximize buttons are
disabled.

bool visible = `true`

  * void set_visible(value: bool)

  * bool is_visible()

If `true`, the window is visible.

bool wrap_controls = `false`

  * void set_wrap_controls(value: bool)

  * bool is_wrapping_controls()

If `true`, the window's size will automatically update when a child node is
added or removed, ignoring min_size if the new size is bigger.

If `false`, you need to call child_controls_changed() manually.

void move_to_center()

Centers a native window on the current screen and an embedded window on its
embedder Viewport.

void move_to_foreground()

Deprecated: Use grab_focus() instead.

Causes the window to grab focus, allowing it to receive user input.

void popup(rect: Rect2i = Rect2i(0, 0, 0, 0))

Shows the Window and makes it transient (see transient). If `rect` is
provided, it will be set as the Window's size. Fails if called on the main
window.

If ProjectSettings.display/window/subwindows/embed_subwindows is `true`
(single-window mode), `rect`'s coordinates are global and relative to the main
window's top-left corner (excluding window decorations). If `rect`'s position
coordinates are negative, the window will be located outside the main window
and may not be visible as a result.

If ProjectSettings.display/window/subwindows/embed_subwindows is `false`
(multi-window mode), `rect`'s coordinates are global and relative to the top-
left corner of the leftmost screen. If `rect`'s position coordinates are
negative, the window will be placed at the top-left corner of the screen.

Note: `rect` must be in global coordinates if specified.

void popup_centered(minsize: Vector2i = Vector2i(0, 0))

Popups the Window at the center of the current screen, with optionally given
minimum size. If the Window is embedded, it will be centered in the parent
Viewport instead.

Note: Calling it with the default value of `minsize` is equivalent to calling
it with size.

void popup_centered_clamped(minsize: Vector2i = Vector2i(0, 0),
fallback_ratio: float = 0.75)

Popups the Window centered inside its parent Window. `fallback_ratio`
determines the maximum size of the Window, in relation to its parent.

Note: Calling it with the default value of `minsize` is equivalent to calling
it with size.

void popup_centered_ratio(ratio: float = 0.8)

If Window is embedded, popups the Window centered inside its embedder and sets
its size as a `ratio` of embedder's size.

If Window is a native window, popups the Window centered inside the screen of
its parent Window and sets its size as a `ratio` of the screen size.

void popup_exclusive(from_node: Node, rect: Rect2i = Rect2i(0, 0, 0, 0))

Attempts to parent this dialog to the last exclusive window relative to
`from_node`, and then calls popup() on it. The dialog must have no current
parent, otherwise the method fails.

See also set_unparent_when_invisible() and Node.get_last_exclusive_window().

void popup_exclusive_centered(from_node: Node, minsize: Vector2i = Vector2i(0,
0))

Attempts to parent this dialog to the last exclusive window relative to
`from_node`, and then calls popup_centered() on it. The dialog must have no
current parent, otherwise the method fails.

See also set_unparent_when_invisible() and Node.get_last_exclusive_window().

void popup_exclusive_centered_clamped(from_node: Node, minsize: Vector2i =
Vector2i(0, 0), fallback_ratio: float = 0.75)

Attempts to parent this dialog to the last exclusive window relative to
`from_node`, and then calls popup_centered_clamped() on it. The dialog must
have no current parent, otherwise the method fails.

See also set_unparent_when_invisible() and Node.get_last_exclusive_window().

void popup_exclusive_centered_ratio(from_node: Node, ratio: float = 0.8)

Attempts to parent this dialog to the last exclusive window relative to
`from_node`, and then calls popup_centered_ratio() on it. The dialog must have
no current parent, otherwise the method fails.

See also set_unparent_when_invisible() and Node.get_last_exclusive_window().

void popup_exclusive_on_parent(from_node: Node, parent_rect: Rect2i)

Attempts to parent this dialog to the last exclusive window relative to
`from_node`, and then calls popup_on_parent() on it. The dialog must have no
current parent, otherwise the method fails.

See also set_unparent_when_invisible() and Node.get_last_exclusive_window().

void popup_on_parent(parent_rect: Rect2i)

Popups the Window with a position shifted by parent Window's position. If the
Window is embedded, has the same effect as popup().

void remove_theme_color_override(name: StringName)

Removes a local override for a theme Color with the specified `name`
previously added by add_theme_color_override() or via the Inspector dock.

void remove_theme_constant_override(name: StringName)

Removes a local override for a theme constant with the specified `name`
previously added by add_theme_constant_override() or via the Inspector dock.

void remove_theme_font_override(name: StringName)

Removes a local override for a theme Font with the specified `name` previously
added by add_theme_font_override() or via the Inspector dock.

void remove_theme_font_size_override(name: StringName)

Removes a local override for a theme font size with the specified `name`
previously added by add_theme_font_size_override() or via the Inspector dock.

void remove_theme_icon_override(name: StringName)

Removes a local override for a theme icon with the specified `name` previously
added by add_theme_icon_override() or via the Inspector dock.

void remove_theme_stylebox_override(name: StringName)

Removes a local override for a theme StyleBox with the specified `name`
previously added by add_theme_stylebox_override() or via the Inspector dock.

void request_attention()

Tells the OS that the Window needs an attention. This makes the window stand
out in some way depending on the system, e.g. it might blink on the task bar.

void reset_size()

Resets the size to the minimum size, which is the max of min_size and (if
wrap_controls is enabled) get_contents_minimum_size(). This is equivalent to
calling `set_size(Vector2i())` (or any size below the minimum).

void set_flag(flag: Flags, enabled: bool)

Sets a specified window flag.

void set_ime_active(active: bool)

If `active` is `true`, enables system's native IME (Input Method Editor).

void set_ime_position(position: Vector2i)

Moves IME to the given position.

void set_layout_direction(direction: LayoutDirection)

Sets layout direction and text writing direction. Right-to-left layouts are
necessary for certain languages (e.g. Arabic and Hebrew).

void set_unparent_when_invisible(unparent: bool)

If `unparent` is `true`, the window is automatically unparented when going
invisible.

Note: Make sure to keep a reference to the node, otherwise it will be
orphaned. You also need to manually call Node.queue_free() to free the window
if it's not parented.

void set_use_font_oversampling(enable: bool)

Enables font oversampling. This makes fonts look better when they are scaled
up.

void show()

Makes the Window appear. This enables interactions with the Window and doesn't
change any of its property other than visibility (unlike e.g. popup()).

void start_drag()

Starts an interactive drag operation on the window, using the current mouse
position. Call this method when handling a mouse button being pressed to
simulate a pressed event on the window's title bar. Using this method allows
the window to participate in space switching, tiling, and other system
features.

void start_resize(edge: WindowResizeEdge)

Starts an interactive resize operation on the window, using the current mouse
position. Call this method when handling a mouse button being pressed to
simulate a pressed event on the window's edge.
