Separator, TabBar, TextEdit, TextureRect, Tree, VideoStreamPlayer

Base class for all GUI controls. Adapts its position and size based on its
parent control.

## Description

Base class for all UI-related nodes. Control features a bounding rectangle
that defines its extents, an anchor position relative to its parent control or
the current viewport, and offsets relative to the anchor. The offsets update
automatically when the node, any of its parents, or the screen size change.

For more information on Godot's UI system, anchors, offsets, and containers,
see the related tutorials in the manual. To build flexible UIs, you'll need a
mix of UI elements that inherit from Control and Container nodes.

Note: Since both Node2D and Control inherit from CanvasItem, they share
several concepts from the class such as the CanvasItem.z_index and
CanvasItem.visible properties.

User Interface nodes and input

Godot propagates input events via viewports. Each Viewport is responsible for
propagating InputEvents to their child nodes. As the SceneTree.root is a
Window, this already happens automatically for all UI elements in your game.

Input events are propagated through the SceneTree from the root node to all
child nodes by calling Node._input(). For UI elements specifically, it makes
more sense to override the virtual method _gui_input(), which filters out
unrelated input events, such as by checking z-order, mouse_filter, focus, or
if the event was inside of the control's bounding box.

Call accept_event() so no other node receives the event. Once you accept an
input, it becomes handled so Node._unhandled_input() will not process it.

Only one Control node can be in focus. Only the node in focus will receive
events. To get the focus, call grab_focus(). Control nodes lose focus when
another node grabs it, or if you hide the node in focus.

Sets mouse_filter to MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE to tell a Control node to ignore
mouse or touch events. You'll need it if you place an icon on top of a button.

Theme resources change the control's appearance. The theme of a Control node
affects all of its direct and indirect children (as long as a chain of
controls is uninterrupted). To override some of the theme items, call one of
the `add_theme_*_override` methods, like add_theme_font_override(). You can
also override theme items in the Inspector.

Note: Theme items are not Object properties. This means you can't access their
values using Object.get() and Object.set(). Instead, use the `get_theme_*` and
`add_theme_*_override` methods provided by this class.

## Signals

focus_entered()

Emitted when the node gains focus.

focus_exited()

Emitted when the node loses focus.

gui_input(event: InputEvent)

Emitted when the node receives an InputEvent.

minimum_size_changed()

Emitted when the node's minimum size changes.

mouse_entered()

Emitted when the mouse cursor enters the control's (or any child control's)
visible area, that is not occluded behind other Controls or Windows, provided
its mouse_filter lets the event reach it and regardless if it's currently
focused or not.

Note: CanvasItem.z_index doesn't affect, which Control receives the signal.

mouse_exited()

Emitted when the mouse cursor leaves the control's (and all child control's)
visible area, that is not occluded behind other Controls or Windows, provided
its mouse_filter lets the event reach it and regardless if it's currently
focused or not.

Note: CanvasItem.z_index doesn't affect, which Control receives the signal.

Note: If you want to check whether the mouse truly left the area, ignoring any
top nodes, you can use code like this:

    
    
    func _on_mouse_exited():
        if not Rect2(Vector2(), size).has_point(get_local_mouse_position()):
            # Not hovering over area.

Emitted when one of the size flags changes. See size_flags_horizontal and
size_flags_vertical.

theme_changed()

Emitted when the NOTIFICATION_THEME_CHANGED notification is sent.

LayoutPreset PRESET_FULL_RECT = `15`

Snap all 4 anchors to the respective corners of the parent control. Set all 4
offsets to 0 after you applied this preset and the Control will fit its parent
control. Use with set_anchors_preset().

enum LayoutPresetMode:

The control will be resized to its minimum size.

LayoutPresetMode PRESET_MODE_KEEP_WIDTH = `1`

The control's width will not change.

LayoutPresetMode PRESET_MODE_KEEP_HEIGHT = `2`

The control's height will not change.

LayoutPresetMode PRESET_MODE_KEEP_SIZE = `3`

The control's size will not change.

flags SizeFlags:

SizeFlags SIZE_SHRINK_BEGIN = `0`

Tells the parent Container to align the node with its start, either the top or
the left edge. It is mutually exclusive with SIZE_FILL and other shrink size
flags, but can be used with SIZE_EXPAND in some containers. Use with
size_flags_horizontal and size_flags_vertical.

Note: Setting this flag is equal to not having any size flags.

SizeFlags SIZE_FILL = `1`

Tells the parent Container to expand the bounds of this node to fill all the
available space without pushing any other node. It is mutually exclusive with
shrink size flags. Use with size_flags_horizontal and size_flags_vertical.

SizeFlags SIZE_EXPAND = `2`

Tells the parent Container to let this node take all the available space on
the axis you flag. If multiple neighboring nodes are set to expand, they'll
share the space based on their stretch ratio. See size_flags_stretch_ratio.
Use with size_flags_horizontal and size_flags_vertical.

SizeFlags SIZE_EXPAND_FILL = `3`

Sets the node's size flags to both fill and expand. See SIZE_FILL and
SIZE_EXPAND for more information.

SizeFlags SIZE_SHRINK_CENTER = `4`

Tells the parent Container to center the node in the available space. It is
mutually exclusive with SIZE_FILL and other shrink size flags, but can be used
with SIZE_EXPAND in some containers. Use with size_flags_horizontal and
size_flags_vertical.

SizeFlags SIZE_SHRINK_END = `8`

Tells the parent Container to align the node with its end, either the bottom
or the right edge. It is mutually exclusive with SIZE_FILL and other shrink
size flags, but can be used with SIZE_EXPAND in some containers. Use with
size_flags_horizontal and size_flags_vertical.

enum MouseFilter:

MouseFilter MOUSE_FILTER_STOP = `0`

The control will receive mouse movement input events and mouse button input
events if clicked on through _gui_input(). The control will also receive the
mouse_entered and mouse_exited signals. These events are automatically marked
as handled, and they will not propagate further to other controls. This also
results in blocking signals in other controls.

MouseFilter MOUSE_FILTER_PASS = `1`

The control will receive mouse movement input events and mouse button input
events if clicked on through _gui_input(). The control will also receive the
mouse_entered and mouse_exited signals.

If this control does not handle the event, the event will propagate up to its
parent control if it has one. The event is bubbled up the node hierarchy until
it reaches a non-CanvasItem, a control with MOUSE_FILTER_STOP, or a CanvasItem
with CanvasItem.top_level enabled. This will allow signals to fire in all
controls it reaches. If no control handled it, the event will be passed to
Node._shortcut_input() for further processing.

MouseFilter MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE = `2`

The control will not receive any mouse movement input events nor mouse button
input events through _gui_input(). The control will also not receive the
mouse_entered nor mouse_exited signals. This will not block other controls
from receiving these events or firing the signals. Ignored events will not be
handled automatically. If a child has MOUSE_FILTER_PASS and an event was
passed to this control, the event will further propagate up to the control's
parent.

Note: If the control has received mouse_entered but not mouse_exited, changing
the mouse_filter to MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE will cause mouse_exited to be emitted.

enum GrowDirection:

GrowDirection GROW_DIRECTION_BEGIN = `0`

The control will grow to the left or top to make up if its minimum size is
changed to be greater than its current size on the respective axis.

GrowDirection GROW_DIRECTION_END = `1`

The control will grow to the right or bottom to make up if its minimum size is
changed to be greater than its current size on the respective axis.

GrowDirection GROW_DIRECTION_BOTH = `2`

The control will grow in both directions equally to make up if its minimum
size is changed to be greater than its current size.

enum Anchor:

Anchor ANCHOR_BEGIN = `0`

Snaps one of the 4 anchor's sides to the origin of the node's `Rect`, in the
top left. Use it with one of the `anchor_*` member variables, like
anchor_left. To change all 4 anchors at once, use set_anchors_preset().

Anchor ANCHOR_END = `1`

Snaps one of the 4 anchor's sides to the end of the node's `Rect`, in the
bottom right. Use it with one of the `anchor_*` member variables, like
anchor_left. To change all 4 anchors at once, use set_anchors_preset().

enum LayoutDirection:

LayoutDirection LAYOUT_DIRECTION_INHERITED = `0`

Automatic layout direction, determined from the parent control layout
direction.

LayoutDirection LAYOUT_DIRECTION_APPLICATION_LOCALE = `1`

Automatic layout direction, determined from the current locale. Right-to-left
layout direction is automatically used for languages that require it such as
Arabic and Hebrew, but only if a valid translation file is loaded for the
given language (unless said language is configured as a fallback in
ProjectSettings.internationalization/locale/fallback). For all other languages
(or if no valid translation file is found by Godot), left-to-right layout
direction is used. If using TextServerFallback
(ProjectSettings.internationalization/rendering/text_driver), left-to-right
layout direction is always used regardless of the language. Right-to-left
layout direction can also be forced using
ProjectSettings.internationalization/rendering/force_right_to_left_layout_direction.

LayoutDirection LAYOUT_DIRECTION_LTR = `2`

Left-to-right layout direction.

LayoutDirection LAYOUT_DIRECTION_RTL = `3`

Right-to-left layout direction.

LayoutDirection LAYOUT_DIRECTION_SYSTEM_LOCALE = `4`

Automatic layout direction, determined from the system locale. Right-to-left
layout direction is automatically used for languages that require it such as
Arabic and Hebrew, but only if a valid translation file is loaded for the
given language.. For all other languages (or if no valid translation file is
found by Godot), left-to-right layout direction is used. If using
TextServerFallback
(ProjectSettings.internationalization/rendering/text_driver), left-to-right
layout direction is always used regardless of the language.

LayoutDirection LAYOUT_DIRECTION_MAX = `5`

Represents the size of the LayoutDirection enum.

LayoutDirection LAYOUT_DIRECTION_LOCALE = `1`

Deprecated: Use LAYOUT_DIRECTION_APPLICATION_LOCALE instead.

enum TextDirection:

TextDirection TEXT_DIRECTION_INHERITED = `3`

Text writing direction is the same as layout direction.

TextDirection TEXT_DIRECTION_AUTO = `0`

Automatic text writing direction, determined from the current locale and text
content.

TextDirection TEXT_DIRECTION_LTR = `1`

Left-to-right text writing direction.

TextDirection TEXT_DIRECTION_RTL = `2`

Right-to-left text writing direction.

## Constants

NOTIFICATION_RESIZED = `40`

Sent when the node changes size. Use size to get the new size.

NOTIFICATION_MOUSE_ENTER = `41`

Sent when the mouse cursor enters the control's (or any child control's)
visible area, that is not occluded behind other Controls or Windows, provided
its mouse_filter lets the event reach it and regardless if it's currently
focused or not.

Note: CanvasItem.z_index doesn't affect which Control receives the
notification.

See also NOTIFICATION_MOUSE_ENTER_SELF.

NOTIFICATION_MOUSE_EXIT = `42`

Sent when the mouse cursor leaves the control's (and all child control's)
visible area, that is not occluded behind other Controls or Windows, provided
its mouse_filter lets the event reach it and regardless if it's currently
focused or not.

Note: CanvasItem.z_index doesn't affect which Control receives the
notification.

See also NOTIFICATION_MOUSE_EXIT_SELF.

NOTIFICATION_MOUSE_ENTER_SELF = `60`

Experimental: The reason this notification is sent may change in the future.

Sent when the mouse cursor enters the control's visible area, that is not
occluded behind other Controls or Windows, provided its mouse_filter lets the
event reach it and regardless if it's currently focused or not.

Note: CanvasItem.z_index doesn't affect which Control receives the
notification.

See also NOTIFICATION_MOUSE_ENTER.

NOTIFICATION_MOUSE_EXIT_SELF = `61`

Experimental: The reason this notification is sent may change in the future.

Sent when the mouse cursor leaves the control's visible area, that is not
occluded behind other Controls or Windows, provided its mouse_filter lets the
event reach it and regardless if it's currently focused or not.

Note: CanvasItem.z_index doesn't affect which Control receives the
notification.

See also NOTIFICATION_MOUSE_EXIT.

NOTIFICATION_FOCUS_ENTER = `43`

Sent when the node grabs focus.

NOTIFICATION_FOCUS_EXIT = `44`

Sent when the node loses focus.

NOTIFICATION_THEME_CHANGED = `45`

Sent when the node needs to refresh its theme items. This happens in one of
the following cases:

  * The theme property is changed on this node or any of its ancestors.

  * The theme_type_variation property is changed on this node.

  * One of the node's theme property overrides is changed.

  * The node enters the scene tree.

Note: As an optimization, this notification won't be sent from changes that
occur while this node is outside of the scene tree. Instead, all of the theme
item updates can be applied at once when the node enters the scene tree.

Note: This notification is received alongside Node.NOTIFICATION_ENTER_TREE, so
if you are instantiating a scene, the child nodes will not be initialized yet.
You can use it to setup theming for this node, child nodes created from
script, or if you want to access child nodes added in the editor, make sure
the node is ready using Node.is_node_ready().

NOTIFICATION_SCROLL_BEGIN = `47`

Sent when this node is inside a ScrollContainer which has begun being scrolled
when dragging the scrollable area with a touch event. This notification is not
sent when scrolling by dragging the scrollbar, scrolling with the mouse wheel
or scrolling with keyboard/gamepad events.

Note: This signal is only emitted on Android or iOS, or on desktop/web
platforms when ProjectSettings.input_devices/pointing/emulate_touch_from_mouse
is enabled.

NOTIFICATION_SCROLL_END = `48`

Sent when this node is inside a ScrollContainer which has stopped being
scrolled when dragging the scrollable area with a touch event. This
notification is not sent when scrolling by dragging the scrollbar, scrolling
with the mouse wheel or scrolling with keyboard/gamepad events.

Note: This signal is only emitted on Android or iOS, or on desktop/web
platforms when ProjectSettings.input_devices/pointing/emulate_touch_from_mouse
is enabled.

NOTIFICATION_LAYOUT_DIRECTION_CHANGED = `49`

Sent when the control layout direction is changed from LTR or RTL or vice
versa. This notification is propagated to child Control nodes as result of a
change to layout_direction.

## Property Descriptions

float anchor_bottom = `0.0`

  * float get_anchor(side: Side) const

Anchors the bottom edge of the node to the origin, the center, or the end of
its parent control. It changes how the bottom offset updates when the node
moves or changes size. You can use one of the Anchor constants for
convenience.

float anchor_left = `0.0`

  * float get_anchor(side: Side) const

Anchors the left edge of the node to the origin, the center or the end of its
parent control. It changes how the left offset updates when the node moves or
changes size. You can use one of the Anchor constants for convenience.

float anchor_right = `0.0`

  * float get_anchor(side: Side) const

Anchors the right edge of the node to the origin, the center or the end of its
parent control. It changes how the right offset updates when the node moves or
changes size. You can use one of the Anchor constants for convenience.

float anchor_top = `0.0`

  * float get_anchor(side: Side) const

Anchors the top edge of the node to the origin, the center or the end of its
parent control. It changes how the top offset updates when the node moves or
changes size. You can use one of the Anchor constants for convenience.

bool auto_translate

  * void set_auto_translate(value: bool)

  * bool is_auto_translating()

Deprecated: Use Node.auto_translate_mode instead.

Toggles if any text should automatically change to its translated version
depending on the current locale.

bool clip_contents = `false`

  * void set_clip_contents(value: bool)

  * bool is_clipping_contents()

Enables whether rendering of CanvasItem based children should be clipped to
this control's rectangle. If `true`, parts of a child which would be visibly
outside of this control's rectangle will not be rendered and won't receive
input.

Vector2 custom_minimum_size = `Vector2(0, 0)`

  * void set_custom_minimum_size(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_custom_minimum_size()

The minimum size of the node's bounding rectangle. If you set it to a value
greater than `(0, 0)`, the node's bounding rectangle will always have at least
this size. Note that Control nodes have their internal minimum size returned
by get_minimum_size(). It depends on the control's contents, like text,
textures, or style boxes. The actual minimum size is the maximum value of this
property and the internal minimum size (see get_combined_minimum_size()).

FocusMode focus_mode = `0`

  * void set_focus_mode(value: FocusMode)

  * FocusMode get_focus_mode()

The focus access mode for the control (None, Click or All). Only one Control
can be focused at the same time, and it will receive keyboard, gamepad, and
mouse signals.

NodePath focus_neighbor_bottom = `NodePath("")`

  * void set_focus_neighbor(side: Side, neighbor: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_focus_neighbor(side: Side) const

Tells Godot which node it should give focus to if the user presses the down
arrow on the keyboard or down on a gamepad by default. You can change the key
by editing the ProjectSettings.input/ui_down input action. The node must be a
Control. If this property is not set, Godot will give focus to the closest
Control to the bottom of this one.

NodePath focus_neighbor_left = `NodePath("")`

  * void set_focus_neighbor(side: Side, neighbor: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_focus_neighbor(side: Side) const

Tells Godot which node it should give focus to if the user presses the left
arrow on the keyboard or left on a gamepad by default. You can change the key
by editing the ProjectSettings.input/ui_left input action. The node must be a
Control. If this property is not set, Godot will give focus to the closest
Control to the left of this one.

NodePath focus_neighbor_right = `NodePath("")`

  * void set_focus_neighbor(side: Side, neighbor: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_focus_neighbor(side: Side) const

Tells Godot which node it should give focus to if the user presses the right
arrow on the keyboard or right on a gamepad by default. You can change the key
by editing the ProjectSettings.input/ui_right input action. The node must be a
Control. If this property is not set, Godot will give focus to the closest
Control to the right of this one.

NodePath focus_neighbor_top = `NodePath("")`

  * void set_focus_neighbor(side: Side, neighbor: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_focus_neighbor(side: Side) const

Tells Godot which node it should give focus to if the user presses the top
arrow on the keyboard or top on a gamepad by default. You can change the key
by editing the ProjectSettings.input/ui_up input action. The node must be a
Control. If this property is not set, Godot will give focus to the closest
Control to the top of this one.

NodePath focus_next = `NodePath("")`

  * void set_focus_next(value: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_focus_next()

Tells Godot which node it should give focus to if the user presses `Tab` on a
keyboard by default. You can change the key by editing the
ProjectSettings.input/ui_focus_next input action.

If this property is not set, Godot will select a "best guess" based on
surrounding nodes in the scene tree.

NodePath focus_previous = `NodePath("")`

  * void set_focus_previous(value: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_focus_previous()

Tells Godot which node it should give focus to if the user presses ``Shift` +
`Tab`` on a keyboard by default. You can change the key by editing the
ProjectSettings.input/ui_focus_prev input action.

If this property is not set, Godot will select a "best guess" based on
surrounding nodes in the scene tree.

Vector2 global_position

  * Vector2 get_global_position()

The node's global position, relative to the world (usually to the
CanvasLayer).

GrowDirection grow_horizontal = `1`

  * void set_h_grow_direction(value: GrowDirection)

  * GrowDirection get_h_grow_direction()

Controls the direction on the horizontal axis in which the control should grow
if its horizontal minimum size is changed to be greater than its current size,
as the control always has to be at least the minimum size.

GrowDirection grow_vertical = `1`

  * void set_v_grow_direction(value: GrowDirection)

  * GrowDirection get_v_grow_direction()

Controls the direction on the vertical axis in which the control should grow
if its vertical minimum size is changed to be greater than its current size,
as the control always has to be at least the minimum size.

LayoutDirection layout_direction = `0`

  * void set_layout_direction(value: LayoutDirection)

  * LayoutDirection get_layout_direction()

Controls layout direction and text writing direction. Right-to-left layouts
are necessary for certain languages (e.g. Arabic and Hebrew). See also
is_layout_rtl().

bool localize_numeral_system = `true`

  * void set_localize_numeral_system(value: bool)

  * bool is_localizing_numeral_system()

If `true`, automatically converts code line numbers, list indices, SpinBox and
ProgressBar values from the Western Arabic (0..9) to the numeral systems used
in current locale.

Note: Numbers within the text are not automatically converted, it can be done
manually, using TextServer.format_number().

CursorShape mouse_default_cursor_shape = `0`

  * void set_default_cursor_shape(value: CursorShape)

  * CursorShape get_default_cursor_shape()

The default cursor shape for this control. Useful for Godot plugins and
applications or games that use the system's mouse cursors.

Note: On Linux, shapes may vary depending on the cursor theme of the system.

MouseFilter mouse_filter = `0`

  * void set_mouse_filter(value: MouseFilter)

  * MouseFilter get_mouse_filter()

Controls whether the control will be able to receive mouse button input events
through _gui_input() and how these events should be handled. Also controls
whether the control can receive the mouse_entered, and mouse_exited signals.
See the constants to learn what each does.

bool mouse_force_pass_scroll_events = `true`

  * void set_force_pass_scroll_events(value: bool)

  * bool is_force_pass_scroll_events()

When enabled, scroll wheel events processed by _gui_input() will be passed to
the parent control even if mouse_filter is set to MOUSE_FILTER_STOP.

You should disable it on the root of your UI if you do not want scroll events
to go to the Node._unhandled_input() processing.

Note: Because this property defaults to `true`, this allows nested scrollable
containers to work out of the box.

float offset_bottom = `0.0`

  * void set_offset(side: Side, offset: float)

  * float get_offset(offset: Side) const

Distance between the node's bottom edge and its parent control, based on
anchor_bottom.

Offsets are often controlled by one or multiple parent Container nodes, so you
should not modify them manually if your node is a direct child of a Container.
Offsets update automatically when you move or resize the node.

float offset_left = `0.0`

  * void set_offset(side: Side, offset: float)

  * float get_offset(offset: Side) const

Distance between the node's left edge and its parent control, based on
anchor_left.

Offsets are often controlled by one or multiple parent Container nodes, so you
should not modify them manually if your node is a direct child of a Container.
Offsets update automatically when you move or resize the node.

float offset_right = `0.0`

  * void set_offset(side: Side, offset: float)

  * float get_offset(offset: Side) const

Distance between the node's right edge and its parent control, based on
anchor_right.

Offsets are often controlled by one or multiple parent Container nodes, so you
should not modify them manually if your node is a direct child of a Container.
Offsets update automatically when you move or resize the node.

float offset_top = `0.0`

  * void set_offset(side: Side, offset: float)

  * float get_offset(offset: Side) const

Distance between the node's top edge and its parent control, based on
anchor_top.

Offsets are often controlled by one or multiple parent Container nodes, so you
should not modify them manually if your node is a direct child of a Container.
Offsets update automatically when you move or resize the node.

Vector2 pivot_offset = `Vector2(0, 0)`

  * void set_pivot_offset(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_pivot_offset()

By default, the node's pivot is its top-left corner. When you change its
rotation or scale, it will rotate or scale around this pivot. Set this
property to size / 2 to pivot around the Control's center.

Vector2 position = `Vector2(0, 0)`

  * Vector2 get_position()

The node's position, relative to its containing node. It corresponds to the
rectangle's top-left corner. The property is not affected by pivot_offset.

float rotation = `0.0`

  * void set_rotation(value: float)

  * float get_rotation()

The node's rotation around its pivot, in radians. See pivot_offset to change
the pivot's position.

Note: This property is edited in the inspector in degrees. If you want to use
degrees in a script, use rotation_degrees.

float rotation_degrees

  * void set_rotation_degrees(value: float)

  * float get_rotation_degrees()

Helper property to access rotation in degrees instead of radians.

Vector2 scale = `Vector2(1, 1)`

  * void set_scale(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_scale()

The node's scale, relative to its size. Change this property to scale the node
around its pivot_offset. The Control's tooltip_text will also scale according
to this value.

Note: This property is mainly intended to be used for animation purposes. To
support multiple resolutions in your project, use an appropriate viewport
stretch mode as described in the documentation instead of scaling Controls
individually.

Note: FontFile.oversampling does not take Control scale into account. This
means that scaling up/down will cause bitmap fonts and rasterized (non-MSDF)
dynamic fonts to appear blurry or pixelated. To ensure text remains crisp
regardless of scale, you can enable MSDF font rendering by enabling
ProjectSettings.gui/theme/default_font_multichannel_signed_distance_field
(applies to the default project font only), or enabling Multichannel Signed
Distance Field in the import options of a DynamicFont for custom fonts. On
system fonts, SystemFont.multichannel_signed_distance_field can be enabled in
the inspector.

Note: If the Control node is a child of a Container node, the scale will be
reset to `Vector2(1, 1)` when the scene is instantiated. To set the Control's
scale when it's instantiated, wait for one frame using `await
get_tree().process_frame` then set its scale property.

Node shortcut_context

  * void set_shortcut_context(value: Node)

  * Node get_shortcut_context()

The Node which must be a parent of the focused Control for the shortcut to be
activated. If `null`, the shortcut can be activated when any control is
focused (a global shortcut). This allows shortcuts to be accepted only when
the user has a certain area of the GUI focused.

Vector2 size = `Vector2(0, 0)`

  * Vector2 get_size()

The size of the node's bounding rectangle, in the node's coordinate system.
Container nodes update this property automatically.

BitField[SizeFlags] size_flags_horizontal = `1`

  * void set_h_size_flags(value: BitField[SizeFlags])

  * BitField[SizeFlags] get_h_size_flags()

Tells the parent Container nodes how they should resize and place the node on
the X axis. Use a combination of the SizeFlags constants to change the flags.
See the constants to learn what each does.

float size_flags_stretch_ratio = `1.0`

  * void set_stretch_ratio(value: float)

  * float get_stretch_ratio()

If the node and at least one of its neighbors uses the SIZE_EXPAND size flag,
the parent Container will let it take more or less space depending on this
property. If this node has a stretch ratio of 2 and its neighbor a ratio of 1,
this node will take two thirds of the available space.

BitField[SizeFlags] size_flags_vertical = `1`

  * void set_v_size_flags(value: BitField[SizeFlags])

  * BitField[SizeFlags] get_v_size_flags()

Tells the parent Container nodes how they should resize and place the node on
the Y axis. Use a combination of the SizeFlags constants to change the flags.
See the constants to learn what each does.

Theme theme

  * void set_theme(value: Theme)

  * Theme get_theme()

The Theme resource this node and all its Control and Window children use. If a
child node has its own Theme resource set, theme items are merged with child's
definitions having higher priority.

Note: Window styles will have no effect unless the window is embedded.

StringName theme_type_variation = `&""`

  * void set_theme_type_variation(value: StringName)

  * StringName get_theme_type_variation()

The name of a theme type variation used by this Control to look up its own
theme items. When empty, the class name of the node is used (e.g. `Button` for
the Button control), as well as the class names of all parent classes (in
order of inheritance).

When set, this property gives the highest priority to the type of the
specified name. This type can in turn extend another type, forming a
dependency chain. See Theme.set_type_variation(). If the theme item cannot be
found using this type or its base types, lookup falls back on the class names.

Note: To look up Control's own items use various `get_theme_*` methods without
specifying `theme_type`.

Note: Theme items are looked for in the tree order, from branch to root, where
each Control node is checked for its theme property. The earliest match
against any type/class name is returned. The project-level Theme and the
default Theme are checked last.

AutoTranslateMode tooltip_auto_translate_mode = `0`

  * void set_tooltip_auto_translate_mode(value: AutoTranslateMode)

  * AutoTranslateMode get_tooltip_auto_translate_mode()

Defines if tooltip text should automatically change to its translated version
depending on the current locale. Uses the same auto translate mode as this
control when set to Node.AUTO_TRANSLATE_MODE_INHERIT.

Note: Tooltips customized using _make_custom_tooltip() do not use this auto
translate mode automatically.

String tooltip_text = `""`

  * void set_tooltip_text(value: String)

  * String get_tooltip_text()

The default tooltip text. The tooltip appears when the user's mouse cursor
stays idle over this control for a few moments, provided that the mouse_filter
property is not MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE. The time required for the tooltip to
appear can be changed with the ProjectSettings.gui/timers/tooltip_delay_sec
setting.

This string is the default return value of get_tooltip(). Override
_get_tooltip() to generate tooltip text dynamically. Override
_make_custom_tooltip() to customize the tooltip interface and behavior.

The tooltip popup will use either a default implementation, or a custom one
that you can provide by overriding _make_custom_tooltip(). The default tooltip
includes a PopupPanel and Label whose theme properties can be customized using
Theme methods with the `"TooltipPanel"` and `"TooltipLabel"` respectively. For
example:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    var style_box = StyleBoxFlat.new()
    style_box.set_bg_color(Color(1, 1, 0))
    style_box.set_border_width_all(2)
    # We assume here that the `theme` property has been assigned a custom Theme beforehand.
    theme.set_stylebox("panel", "TooltipPanel", style_box)
    theme.set_color("font_color", "TooltipLabel", Color(0, 1, 1))
    
    
    
    var styleBox = new StyleBoxFlat();
    styleBox.SetBgColor(new Color(1, 1, 0));
    styleBox.SetBorderWidthAll(2);
    // We assume here that the `Theme` property has been assigned a custom Theme beforehand.
    Theme.SetStyleBox("panel", "TooltipPanel", styleBox);
    Theme.SetColor("font_color", "TooltipLabel", new Color(0, 1, 1));
    

## Method Descriptions

bool _can_drop_data(at_position: Vector2, data: Variant) virtual const

Godot calls this method to test if `data` from a control's _get_drag_data()
can be dropped at `at_position`. `at_position` is local to this control.

This method should only be used to test the data. Process the data in
_drop_data().

GDScriptC#

    
    
    func _can_drop_data(position, data):
        # Check position if it is relevant to you
        # Otherwise, just check data
        return typeof(data) == TYPE_DICTIONARY and data.has("expected")
    
    
    
    public override bool _CanDropData(Vector2 atPosition, Variant data)
    {
        // Check position if it is relevant to you
        // Otherwise, just check data
        return data.VariantType == Variant.Type.Dictionary && data.AsGodotDictionary().ContainsKey("expected");
    }
    

void _drop_data(at_position: Vector2, data: Variant) virtual

Godot calls this method to pass you the `data` from a control's
_get_drag_data() result. Godot first calls _can_drop_data() to test if `data`
is allowed to drop at `at_position` where `at_position` is local to this
control.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    func _can_drop_data(position, data):
        return typeof(data) == TYPE_DICTIONARY and data.has("color")
    
    func _drop_data(position, data):
        var color = data["color"]
    
    
    
    public override bool _CanDropData(Vector2 atPosition, Variant data)
    {
        return data.VariantType == Variant.Type.Dictionary && data.AsGodotDictionary().ContainsKey("color");
    }
    
    public override void _DropData(Vector2 atPosition, Variant data)
    {
        Color color = data.AsGodotDictionary()["color"].AsColor();
    }
    

Variant _get_drag_data(at_position: Vector2) virtual

Godot calls this method to get data that can be dragged and dropped onto
controls that expect drop data. Returns `null` if there is no data to drag.
Controls that want to receive drop data should implement _can_drop_data() and
_drop_data(). `at_position` is local to this control. Drag may be forced with
force_drag().

A preview that will follow the mouse that should represent the data can be set
with set_drag_preview(). A good time to set the preview is in this method.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    func _get_drag_data(position):
        var mydata = make_data() # This is your custom method generating the drag data.
        set_drag_preview(make_preview(mydata)) # This is your custom method generating the preview of the drag data.
        return mydata
    
    
    
    public override Variant _GetDragData(Vector2 atPosition)
    {
        var myData = MakeData(); // This is your custom method generating the drag data.
        SetDragPreview(MakePreview(myData)); // This is your custom method generating the preview of the drag data.
        return myData;
    }
    

Vector2 _get_minimum_size() virtual const

Virtual method to be implemented by the user. Returns the minimum size for
this control. Alternative to custom_minimum_size for controlling minimum size
via code. The actual minimum size will be the max value of these two (in each
axis separately).

If not overridden, defaults to Vector2.ZERO.

Note: This method will not be called when the script is attached to a Control
node that already overrides its minimum size (e.g. Label, Button,
PanelContainer etc.). It can only be used with most basic GUI nodes, like
Control, Container, Panel etc.

String _get_tooltip(at_position: Vector2) virtual const

Virtual method to be implemented by the user. Returns the tooltip text for the
position `at_position` in control's local coordinates, which will typically
appear when the cursor is resting over this control. See get_tooltip().

Note: If this method returns an empty String and _make_custom_tooltip() is not
overridden, no tooltip is displayed.

void _gui_input(event: InputEvent) virtual

Virtual method to be implemented by the user. Override this method to handle
and accept inputs on UI elements. See also accept_event().

Example: Click on the control to print a message:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    func _gui_input(event):
        if event is InputEventMouseButton:
            if event.button_index == MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT and event.pressed:
                print("I've been clicked D:")
    
    
    
    public override void _GuiInput(InputEvent @event)
    {
        if (@event is InputEventMouseButton mb)
        {
            if (mb.ButtonIndex == MouseButton.Left && mb.Pressed)
            {
                GD.Print("I've been clicked D:");
            }
        }
    }
    

If the `event` inherits InputEventMouse, this method will not be called when:

  * the control's mouse_filter is set to MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE;

  * the control is obstructed by another control on top, that doesn't have mouse_filter set to MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE;

  * the control's parent has mouse_filter set to MOUSE_FILTER_STOP or has accepted the event;

  * the control's parent has clip_contents enabled and the `event`'s position is outside the parent's rectangle;

  * the `event`'s position is outside the control (see _has_point()).

Note: The `event`'s position is relative to this control's origin.

bool _has_point(point: Vector2) virtual const

Virtual method to be implemented by the user. Returns whether the given
`point` is inside this control.

If not overridden, default behavior is checking if the point is within
control's Rect.

Note: If you want to check if a point is inside the control, you can use
`Rect2(Vector2.ZERO, size).has_point(point)`.

Object _make_custom_tooltip(for_text: String) virtual const

Virtual method to be implemented by the user. Returns a Control node that
should be used as a tooltip instead of the default one. `for_text` is the
return value of get_tooltip().

The returned node must be of type Control or Control-derived. It can have
child nodes of any type. It is freed when the tooltip disappears, so make sure
you always provide a new instance (if you want to use a pre-existing node from
your scene tree, you can duplicate it and pass the duplicated instance). When
`null` or a non-Control node is returned, the default tooltip will be used
instead.

The returned node will be added as child to a PopupPanel, so you should only
provide the contents of that panel. That PopupPanel can be themed using
Theme.set_stylebox() for the type `"TooltipPanel"` (see tooltip_text for an
example).

Note: The tooltip is shrunk to minimal size. If you want to ensure it's fully
visible, you might want to set its custom_minimum_size to some non-zero value.

Note: The node (and any relevant children) should have their
CanvasItem.visible set to `true` when returned, otherwise, the viewport that
instantiates it will not be able to calculate its minimum size reliably.

Note: If overridden, this method is called even if get_tooltip() returns an
empty string. When this happens with the default tooltip, it is not displayed.
To copy this behavior, return `null` in this method when `for_text` is empty.

Example: Use a constructed node as a tooltip:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    func _make_custom_tooltip(for_text):
        var label = Label.new()
        label.text = for_text
        return label
    
    
    
    public override Control _MakeCustomTooltip(string forText)
    {
        var label = new Label();
        label.Text = forText;
        return label;
    }
    

Example: Usa a scene instance as a tooltip:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    func _make_custom_tooltip(for_text):
        var tooltip = preload("res://some_tooltip_scene.tscn").instantiate()
        tooltip.get_node("Label").text = for_text
        return tooltip
    
    
    
    public override Control _MakeCustomTooltip(string forText)
    {
        Node tooltip = ResourceLoader.Load<PackedScene>("res://some_tooltip_scene.tscn").Instantiate();
        tooltip.GetNode<Label>("Label").Text = forText;
        return tooltip;
    }
    

Array[Vector3i] _structured_text_parser(args: Array, text: String) virtual
const

User defined BiDi algorithm override function.

Returns an Array of Vector3i text ranges and text base directions, in the
left-to-right order. Ranges should cover full source `text` without overlaps.
BiDi algorithm will be used on each range separately.

void accept_event()

Marks an input event as handled. Once you accept an input event, it stops
propagating, even to nodes listening to Node._unhandled_input() or
Node._unhandled_key_input().

Note: This does not affect the methods in Input, only the way events are
propagated.

void add_theme_color_override(name: StringName, color: Color)

Creates a local override for a theme Color with the specified `name`. Local
overrides always take precedence when fetching theme items for the control. An
override can be removed with remove_theme_color_override().

See also get_theme_color().

Example: Override a Label's color and reset it later:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    # Given the child Label node "MyLabel", override its font color with a custom value.
    $MyLabel.add_theme_color_override("font_color", Color(1, 0.5, 0))
    # Reset the font color of the child label.
    $MyLabel.remove_theme_color_override("font_color")
    # Alternatively it can be overridden with the default value from the Label type.
    $MyLabel.add_theme_color_override("font_color", get_theme_color("font_color", "Label"))
    
    
    
    // Given the child Label node "MyLabel", override its font color with a custom value.
    GetNode<Label>("MyLabel").AddThemeColorOverride("font_color", new Color(1, 0.5f, 0));
    // Reset the font color of the child label.
    GetNode<Label>("MyLabel").RemoveThemeColorOverride("font_color");
    // Alternatively it can be overridden with the default value from the Label type.
    GetNode<Label>("MyLabel").AddThemeColorOverride("font_color", GetThemeColor("font_color", "Label"));
    

void add_theme_constant_override(name: StringName, constant: int)

Creates a local override for a theme constant with the specified `name`. Local
overrides always take precedence when fetching theme items for the control. An
override can be removed with remove_theme_constant_override().

See also get_theme_constant().

void add_theme_font_override(name: StringName, font: Font)

Creates a local override for a theme Font with the specified `name`. Local
overrides always take precedence when fetching theme items for the control. An
override can be removed with remove_theme_font_override().

See also get_theme_font().

void add_theme_font_size_override(name: StringName, font_size: int)

Creates a local override for a theme font size with the specified `name`.
Local overrides always take precedence when fetching theme items for the
control. An override can be removed with remove_theme_font_size_override().

See also get_theme_font_size().

void add_theme_icon_override(name: StringName, texture: Texture2D)

Creates a local override for a theme icon with the specified `name`. Local
overrides always take precedence when fetching theme items for the control. An
override can be removed with remove_theme_icon_override().

See also get_theme_icon().

void add_theme_stylebox_override(name: StringName, stylebox: StyleBox)

Creates a local override for a theme StyleBox with the specified `name`. Local
overrides always take precedence when fetching theme items for the control. An
override can be removed with remove_theme_stylebox_override().

See also get_theme_stylebox().

Example: Modify a property in a StyleBox by duplicating it:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    # The snippet below assumes the child node "MyButton" has a StyleBoxFlat assigned.
    # Resources are shared across instances, so we need to duplicate it
    # to avoid modifying the appearance of all other buttons.
    var new_stylebox_normal = $MyButton.get_theme_stylebox("normal").duplicate()
    new_stylebox_normal.border_width_top = 3
    new_stylebox_normal.border_color = Color(0, 1, 0.5)
    $MyButton.add_theme_stylebox_override("normal", new_stylebox_normal)
    # Remove the stylebox override.
    $MyButton.remove_theme_stylebox_override("normal")
    
    
    
    // The snippet below assumes the child node "MyButton" has a StyleBoxFlat assigned.
    // Resources are shared across instances, so we need to duplicate it
    // to avoid modifying the appearance of all other buttons.
    StyleBoxFlat newStyleboxNormal = GetNode<Button>("MyButton").GetThemeStylebox("normal").Duplicate() as StyleBoxFlat;
    newStyleboxNormal.BorderWidthTop = 3;
    newStyleboxNormal.BorderColor = new Color(0, 1, 0.5f);
    GetNode<Button>("MyButton").AddThemeStyleboxOverride("normal", newStyleboxNormal);
    // Remove the stylebox override.
    GetNode<Button>("MyButton").RemoveThemeStyleboxOverride("normal");
    

void begin_bulk_theme_override()

Prevents `*_theme_*_override` methods from emitting NOTIFICATION_THEME_CHANGED
until end_bulk_theme_override() is called.

void end_bulk_theme_override()

Ends a bulk theme override update. See begin_bulk_theme_override().

Control find_next_valid_focus() const

Finds the next (below in the tree) Control that can receive the focus.

Control find_prev_valid_focus() const

Finds the previous (above in the tree) Control that can receive the focus.

Control find_valid_focus_neighbor(side: Side) const

Finds the next Control that can receive the focus on the specified Side.

Note: This is different from get_focus_neighbor(), which returns the path of a
specified focus neighbor.

void force_drag(data: Variant, preview: Control)

Forces drag and bypasses _get_drag_data() and set_drag_preview() by passing
`data` and `preview`. Drag will start even if the mouse is neither over nor
pressed on this control.

The methods _can_drop_data() and _drop_data() must be implemented on controls
that want to receive drop data.

float get_anchor(side: Side) const

Returns the anchor for the specified Side. A getter method for anchor_bottom,
anchor_left, anchor_right and anchor_top.

Vector2 get_begin() const

Returns offset_left and offset_top. See also position.

Vector2 get_combined_minimum_size() const

Returns combined minimum size from custom_minimum_size and get_minimum_size().

CursorShape get_cursor_shape(position: Vector2 = Vector2(0, 0)) const

Returns the mouse cursor shape the control displays on mouse hover. See
CursorShape.

Vector2 get_end() const

Returns offset_right and offset_bottom.

NodePath get_focus_neighbor(side: Side) const

Returns the focus neighbor for the specified Side. A getter method for
focus_neighbor_bottom, focus_neighbor_left, focus_neighbor_right and
focus_neighbor_top.

Note: To find the next Control on the specific Side, even if a neighbor is not
assigned, use find_valid_focus_neighbor().

Rect2 get_global_rect() const

Returns the position and size of the control relative to the containing
canvas. See global_position and size.

Note: If the node itself or any parent CanvasItem between the node and the
canvas have a non default rotation or skew, the resulting size is likely not
meaningful.

Note: Setting Viewport.gui_snap_controls_to_pixels to `true` can lead to
rounding inaccuracies between the displayed control and the returned Rect2.

Vector2 get_minimum_size() const

Returns the minimum size for this control. See custom_minimum_size.

float get_offset(offset: Side) const

Returns the offset for the specified Side. A getter method for offset_bottom,
offset_left, offset_right and offset_top.

Vector2 get_parent_area_size() const

Returns the width/height occupied in the parent control.

Control get_parent_control() const

Returns the parent control node.

Rect2 get_rect() const

Returns the position and size of the control in the coordinate system of the
containing node. See position, scale and size.

Note: If rotation is not the default rotation, the resulting size is not
meaningful.

Note: Setting Viewport.gui_snap_controls_to_pixels to `true` can lead to
rounding inaccuracies between the displayed control and the returned Rect2.

Vector2 get_screen_position() const

Returns the position of this Control in global screen coordinates (i.e. taking
window position into account). Mostly useful for editor plugins.

Equals to global_position if the window is embedded (see
Viewport.gui_embed_subwindows).

Example: Show a popup at the mouse position:

    
    
    popup_menu.position = get_screen_position() + get_local_mouse_position()
    popup_menu.reset_size()
    popup_menu.popup()
    

Color get_theme_color(name: StringName, theme_type: StringName = &"") const

Returns a Color from the first matching Theme in the tree if that Theme has a
color item with the specified `name` and `theme_type`. If `theme_type` is
omitted the class name of the current control is used as the type, or
theme_type_variation if it is defined. If the type is a class name its parent
classes are also checked, in order of inheritance. If the type is a variation
its base types are checked, in order of dependency, then the control's class
name and its parent classes are checked.

For the current control its local overrides are considered first (see
add_theme_color_override()), then its assigned theme. After the current
control, each parent control and its assigned theme are considered; controls
without a theme assigned are skipped. If no matching Theme is found in the
tree, the custom project Theme (see ProjectSettings.gui/theme/custom) and the
default Theme are used (see ThemeDB).

GDScriptC#

    
    
    func _ready():
        # Get the font color defined for the current Control's class, if it exists.
        modulate = get_theme_color("font_color")
        # Get the font color defined for the Button class.
        modulate = get_theme_color("font_color", "Button")
    
    
    
    public override void _Ready()
    {
        // Get the font color defined for the current Control's class, if it exists.
        Modulate = GetThemeColor("font_color");
        // Get the font color defined for the Button class.
        Modulate = GetThemeColor("font_color", "Button");
    }
    

int get_theme_constant(name: StringName, theme_type: StringName = &"") const

Returns a Font from the first matching Theme in the tree if that Theme has a
font item with the specified `name` and `theme_type`.

See get_theme_color() for details.

int get_theme_font_size(name: StringName, theme_type: StringName = &"") const

Returns a font size from the first matching Theme in the tree if that Theme
has a font size item with the specified `name` and `theme_type`.

See get_theme_color() for details.

Texture2D get_theme_icon(name: StringName, theme_type: StringName = &"") const

Returns an icon from the first matching Theme in the tree if that Theme has an
icon item with the specified `name` and `theme_type`.

See get_theme_color() for details.

StyleBox get_theme_stylebox(name: StringName, theme_type: StringName = &"")
const

Returns a StyleBox from the first matching Theme in the tree if that Theme has
a stylebox item with the specified `name` and `theme_type`.

See get_theme_color() for details.

String get_tooltip(at_position: Vector2 = Vector2(0, 0)) const

Returns the tooltip text for the position `at_position` in control's local
coordinates, which will typically appear when the cursor is resting over this
control. By default, it returns tooltip_text.

This method can be overridden to customize its behavior. See _get_tooltip().

Note: If this method returns an empty String and _make_custom_tooltip() is not
overridden, no tooltip is displayed.

void grab_click_focus()

Creates an InputEventMouseButton that attempts to click the control. If the
event is received, the control gains focus.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    func _process(delta):
        grab_click_focus() # When clicking another Control node, this node will be clicked instead.
    
    
    
    public override void _Process(double delta)
    {
        GrabClickFocus(); // When clicking another Control node, this node will be clicked instead.
    }
    

void grab_focus()

Steal the focus from another control and become the focused control (see
focus_mode).

Note: Using this method together with Callable.call_deferred() makes it more
reliable, especially when called inside Node._ready().

item with the specified `name` and `theme_type`.

See get_theme_color() for details.

bool has_theme_font_size_override(name: StringName) const

Returns `true` if there is a local override for a theme font size with the
specified `name` in this Control node.

See add_theme_font_size_override().

bool has_theme_icon(name: StringName, theme_type: StringName = &"") const

Removes a local override for a theme StyleBox with the specified `name`
previously added by add_theme_stylebox_override() or via the Inspector dock.

void reset_size()

Resets the size to get_combined_minimum_size(). This is equivalent to calling
`set_size(Vector2())` (or any size below the minimum).

void set_anchor(side: Side, anchor: float, keep_offset: bool = false,
push_opposite_anchor: bool = true)

Sets the anchor for the specified Side to `anchor`. A setter method for
anchor_bottom, anchor_left, anchor_right and anchor_top.

If `keep_offset` is `true`, offsets aren't updated after this operation.

If `push_opposite_anchor` is `true` and the opposite anchor overlaps this
anchor, the opposite one will have its value overridden. For example, when
setting left anchor to 1 and the right anchor has value of 0.5, the right
anchor will also get value of 1. If `push_opposite_anchor` was `false`, the
left anchor would get value 0.5.

void set_anchor_and_offset(side: Side, anchor: float, offset: float,
push_opposite_anchor: bool = false)

Works the same as set_anchor(), but instead of `keep_offset` argument and
automatic update of offset, it allows to set the offset yourself (see
set_offset()).

void set_anchors_and_offsets_preset(preset: LayoutPreset, resize_mode:
LayoutPresetMode = 0, margin: int = 0)

Sets both anchor preset and offset preset. See set_anchors_preset() and
set_offsets_preset().

void set_anchors_preset(preset: LayoutPreset, keep_offsets: bool = false)

Sets the anchors to a `preset` from LayoutPreset enum. This is the code
equivalent to using the Layout menu in the 2D editor.

If `keep_offsets` is `true`, control's position will also be updated.

void set_begin(position: Vector2)

Sets offset_left and offset_top at the same time. Equivalent of changing
position.

void set_drag_forwarding(drag_func: Callable, can_drop_func: Callable,
drop_func: Callable)

Sets the given callables to be used instead of the control's own drag-and-drop
virtual methods. If a callable is empty, its respective virtual method is used
as normal.

The arguments for each callable should be exactly the same as their respective
virtual methods, which would be:

  * `drag_func` corresponds to _get_drag_data() and requires a Vector2;

  * `can_drop_func` corresponds to _can_drop_data() and requires both a Vector2 and a Variant;

  * `drop_func` corresponds to _drop_data() and requires both a Vector2 and a Variant.

void set_drag_preview(control: Control)

Shows the given control at the mouse pointer. A good time to call this method
is in _get_drag_data(). The control must not be in the scene tree. You should
not free the control, and you should not keep a reference to the control
beyond the duration of the drag. It will be deleted automatically after the
drag has ended.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    @export var color = Color(1, 0, 0, 1)
    
    func _get_drag_data(position):
        # Use a control that is not in the tree
        var cpb = ColorPickerButton.new()
        cpb.color = color
        cpb.size = Vector2(50, 50)
        set_drag_preview(cpb)
        return color
    
    
    
    [Export]
    private Color _color = new Color(1, 0, 0, 1);
    
    public override Variant _GetDragData(Vector2 atPosition)
    {
        // Use a control that is not in the tree
        var cpb = new ColorPickerButton();
        cpb.Color = _color;
        cpb.Size = new Vector2(50, 50);
        SetDragPreview(cpb);
        return _color;
    }
    

void set_end(position: Vector2)

Sets offset_right and offset_bottom at the same time.

void set_focus_neighbor(side: Side, neighbor: NodePath)

Sets the focus neighbor for the specified Side to the Control at `neighbor`
node path. A setter method for focus_neighbor_bottom, focus_neighbor_left,
focus_neighbor_right and focus_neighbor_top.

void set_global_position(position: Vector2, keep_offsets: bool = false)

Sets the global_position to given `position`.

If `keep_offsets` is `true`, control's anchors will be updated instead of
offsets.

void set_offset(side: Side, offset: float)

Sets the offset for the specified Side to `offset`. A setter method for
offset_bottom, offset_left, offset_right and offset_top.

void set_offsets_preset(preset: LayoutPreset, resize_mode: LayoutPresetMode =
0, margin: int = 0)

Sets the offsets to a `preset` from LayoutPreset enum. This is the code
equivalent to using the Layout menu in the 2D editor.

Use parameter `resize_mode` with constants from LayoutPresetMode to better
determine the resulting size of the Control. Constant size will be ignored if
used with presets that change size, e.g. PRESET_LEFT_WIDE.

Use parameter `margin` to determine the gap between the Control and the edges.

void set_position(position: Vector2, keep_offsets: bool = false)

Sets the position to given `position`.

If `keep_offsets` is `true`, control's anchors will be updated instead of
offsets.

void set_size(size: Vector2, keep_offsets: bool = false)

Sets the size (see size).

If `keep_offsets` is `true`, control's anchors will be updated instead of
offsets.

void update_minimum_size()

Invalidates the size cache in this node and in parent nodes up to top level.
Intended to be used with get_minimum_size() when the return value is changed.
Setting custom_minimum_size directly calls this method automatically.

void warp_mouse(position: Vector2)

Moves the mouse cursor to `position`, relative to position of this Control.

Note: warp_mouse() is only supported on Windows, macOS and Linux. It has no
effect on Android, iOS and Web.
