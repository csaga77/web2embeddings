# PhysicalBoneSimulator3D

Inherits: SkeletonModifier3D < Node3D < Node < Object

Node that can be the parent of PhysicalBone3D and can apply the simulation
results to Skeleton3D.

## Description

Node that can be the parent of PhysicalBone3D and can apply the simulation
results to Skeleton3D.

---|---  
void | physical_bones_add_collision_exception(exception: RID)

## Method Descriptions

bool is_simulating_physics() const

Returns a boolean that indicates whether the PhysicalBoneSimulator3D is
running and simulating.

void physical_bones_add_collision_exception(exception: RID)

Adds a collision exception to the physical bone.

Works just like the RigidBody3D node.

void physical_bones_remove_collision_exception(exception: RID)

Removes a collision exception to the physical bone.

Works just like the RigidBody3D node.

void physical_bones_start_simulation(bones: Array[StringName] = [])

Tells the PhysicalBone3D nodes in the Skeleton to start simulating and
reacting to the physics world.

Optionally, a list of bone names can be passed-in, allowing only the passed-in
bones to be simulated.

void physical_bones_stop_simulation()

Tells the PhysicalBone3D nodes in the Skeleton to stop simulating.
