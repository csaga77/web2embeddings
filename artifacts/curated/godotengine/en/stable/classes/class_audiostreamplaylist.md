# AudioStreamPlaylist

Inherits: AudioStream < Resource < RefCounted < Object

AudioStream that includes sub-streams and plays them back like a playlist.

## Properties

float | fade_time | `0.3`  
---|---|---  
bool | loop | `true`  
bool | shuffle | `false`  
int | stream_count | `0`  
  
## Methods

float | get_bpm() const  
---|---  
AudioStream | get_list_stream(stream_index: int) const  
void | set_list_stream(stream_index: int, audio_stream: AudioStream)  
  
## Constants

MAX_STREAMS = `64`

Maximum amount of streams supported in the playlist.

## Property Descriptions

float fade_time = `0.3`

  * void set_fade_time(value: float)

  * float get_fade_time()

Fade time used when a stream ends, when going to the next one. Streams are
expected to have an extra bit of audio after the end to help with fading.

bool loop = `true`

  * void set_loop(value: bool)

  * bool has_loop()

If `true`, the playlist will loop, otherwise the playlist will end when the
last stream is finished.

bool shuffle = `false`

  * void set_shuffle(value: bool)

  * bool get_shuffle()

If `true`, the playlist will shuffle each time playback starts and each time
it loops.

int stream_count = `0`

  * void set_stream_count(value: int)

  * int get_stream_count()

Amount of streams in the playlist.

## Method Descriptions

float get_bpm() const

Returns the BPM of the playlist, which can vary depending on the clip being
played.

AudioStream get_list_stream(stream_index: int) const

Returns the stream at playback position index.

void set_list_stream(stream_index: int, audio_stream: AudioStream)

Sets the stream at playback position index.
