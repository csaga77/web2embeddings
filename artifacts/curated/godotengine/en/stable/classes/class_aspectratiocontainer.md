# AspectRatioContainer

Inherits: Container < Control < CanvasItem < Node < Object

A container that preserves the proportions of its child controls.

## Description

A container type that arranges its child controls in a way that preserves
their proportions automatically when the container is resized. Useful when a
container has a dynamic size and the child nodes must adjust their sizes
accordingly without losing their aspect ratios.

## Properties

AlignmentMode | alignment_horizontal | `1`  
---|---|---  
AlignmentMode | alignment_vertical | `1`  
float | ratio | `1.0`  
StretchMode | stretch_mode | `2`  
  
## Enumerations

enum StretchMode:

StretchMode STRETCH_WIDTH_CONTROLS_HEIGHT = `0`

The height of child controls is automatically adjusted based on the width of
the container.

StretchMode STRETCH_HEIGHT_CONTROLS_WIDTH = `1`

The width of child controls is automatically adjusted based on the height of
the container.

StretchMode STRETCH_FIT = `2`

The bounding rectangle of child controls is automatically adjusted to fit
inside the container while keeping the aspect ratio.

StretchMode STRETCH_COVER = `3`

The width and height of child controls is automatically adjusted to make their
bounding rectangle cover the entire area of the container while keeping the
aspect ratio.

When the bounding rectangle of child controls exceed the container's size and
Control.clip_contents is enabled, this allows to show only the container's
area restricted by its own bounding rectangle.

enum AlignmentMode:

AlignmentMode ALIGNMENT_BEGIN = `0`

Aligns child controls with the beginning (left or top) of the container.

AlignmentMode ALIGNMENT_CENTER = `1`

Aligns child controls with the center of the container.

AlignmentMode ALIGNMENT_END = `2`

Aligns child controls with the end (right or bottom) of the container.

## Property Descriptions

AlignmentMode alignment_horizontal = `1`

  * void set_alignment_horizontal(value: AlignmentMode)

  * AlignmentMode get_alignment_horizontal()

Specifies the horizontal relative position of child controls.

AlignmentMode alignment_vertical = `1`

  * void set_alignment_vertical(value: AlignmentMode)

  * AlignmentMode get_alignment_vertical()

Specifies the vertical relative position of child controls.

float ratio = `1.0`

  * void set_ratio(value: float)

  * float get_ratio()

The aspect ratio to enforce on child controls. This is the width divided by
the height. The ratio depends on the stretch_mode.

StretchMode stretch_mode = `2`

  * void set_stretch_mode(value: StretchMode)

  * StretchMode get_stretch_mode()

The stretch mode used to align child controls.
