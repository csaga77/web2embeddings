# X509Certificate

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

An X509 certificate (e.g. for TLS).

## Description

The X509Certificate class represents an X509 certificate. Certificates can be
loaded and saved like any other Resource.

They can be used as the server certificate in StreamPeerTLS.accept_stream()
(along with the proper CryptoKey), and to specify the only certificate that
should be accepted when connecting to a TLS server via
StreamPeerTLS.connect_to_stream().
