# ResourceFormatSaver

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Saves a specific resource type to a file.

## Description

The engine can save resources when you do it from the editor, or when you use
the ResourceSaver singleton. This is accomplished thanks to multiple
ResourceFormatSavers, each handling its own format and called automatically by
the engine.

By default, Godot saves resources as `.tres` (text-based), `.res` (binary) or
another built-in format, but you can choose to create your own format by
extending this class. Be sure to respect the documented return types and
values. You should give it a global class name with `class_name` for it to be
registered. Like built-in ResourceFormatSavers, it will be called
automatically when saving resources of its recognized type(s). You may also
implement a ResourceFormatLoader.

## Methods

PackedStringArray | _get_recognized_extensions(resource: Resource) virtual const  
---|---  
bool | _recognize(resource: Resource) virtual const  
bool | _recognize_path(resource: Resource, path: String) virtual const  
Error | _save(resource: Resource, path: String, flags: int) virtual  
Error | _set_uid(path: String, uid: int) virtual  
  
## Method Descriptions

PackedStringArray _get_recognized_extensions(resource: Resource) virtual const

Returns the list of extensions available for saving the resource object,
provided it is recognized (see _recognize()).

bool _recognize(resource: Resource) virtual const

Returns whether the given resource object can be saved by this saver.

bool _recognize_path(resource: Resource, path: String) virtual const

Returns `true` if this saver handles a given save path and `false` otherwise.

If this method is not implemented, the default behavior returns whether the
path's extension is within the ones provided by _get_recognized_extensions().

Error _save(resource: Resource, path: String, flags: int) virtual

Saves the given resource object to a file at the target `path`. `flags` is a
bitmask composed with SaverFlags constants.

Returns @GlobalScope.OK on success, or an Error constant in case of failure.

Error _set_uid(path: String, uid: int) virtual

Sets a new UID for the resource at the given `path`. Returns @GlobalScope.OK
on success, or an Error constant in case of failure.
