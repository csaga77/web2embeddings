GLTFDocument extension class.

## Description

Extends the functionality of the GLTFDocument class by allowing you to run
arbitrary code at various stages of glTF import or export.

To use, make a new class extending GLTFDocumentExtension, override any methods
you need, make an instance of your class, and register it using
GLTFDocument.register_gltf_document_extension().

Note: Like GLTFDocument itself, all GLTFDocumentExtension classes must be
stateless in order to function properly. If you need to store data, use the
`set_additional_data` and `get_additional_data` methods in GLTFState or
GLTFNode.

## Method Descriptions

void _convert_scene_node(state: GLTFState, gltf_node: GLTFNode, scene_node:
Node) virtual

Part of the export process. This method is run after _export_preflight() and
before _export_post_convert().

Runs when converting the data from a Godot scene node. This method can be used
to process the Godot scene node data into a format that can be used by
_export_node().

Error _export_node(state: GLTFState, gltf_node: GLTFNode, json: Dictionary,
node: Node) virtual

Part of the export process. This method is run after
_get_saveable_image_formats() and before _export_post(). If this
GLTFDocumentExtension is used for exporting images, this runs after
_serialize_texture_json().

This method can be used to modify the final JSON of each node. Data should be
primarily stored in `gltf_node` prior to serializing the JSON, but the
original Godot Node is also provided if available. `node` may be `null` if not
available, such as when exporting glTF data not generated from a Godot scene.

GLTFObjectModelProperty _export_object_model_property(state: GLTFState,
node_path: NodePath, godot_node: Node, gltf_node_index: int, target_object:
Object, target_depth: int) virtual

Part of the export process. Allows GLTFDocumentExtension classes to provide
mappings for properties of nodes in the Godot scene tree, to JSON pointers to
glTF properties, as defined by the glTF object model.

Returns a GLTFObjectModelProperty instance that defines how the property
should be mapped. If your extension can't handle the property, return `null`
or an instance without any JSON pointers (see
GLTFObjectModelProperty.has_json_pointers()). You should use
GLTFObjectModelProperty.set_types() to set the types, and set the JSON
pointer(s) using the GLTFObjectModelProperty.json_pointers property.

The parameters provide context for the property, including the NodePath, the
Godot node, the GLTF node index, and the target object. The `target_object`
will be equal to `godot_node` if no sub-object can be found, otherwise it will
point to a sub-object. For example, if the path is
`^"A/B/C/MeshInstance3D:mesh:surface_0/material:emission_intensity"`, it will
get the node, then the mesh, and then the material, so `target_object` will be
the Material resource, and `target_depth` will be 2 because 2 levels were
traversed to get to the target.

Error _export_post(state: GLTFState) virtual

Part of the export process. This method is run last, after all other parts of
the export process.

This method can be used to modify the final JSON of the generated glTF file.

Error _export_post_convert(state: GLTFState, root: Node) virtual

Part of the export process. This method is run after _convert_scene_node() and
before _export_preserialize().

This method can be used to modify the converted node data structures before
serialization with any additional data from the scene tree.

Error _export_preflight(state: GLTFState, root: Node) virtual

Part of the export process. This method is run first, before all other parts
of the export process.

The return value is used to determine if this GLTFDocumentExtension instance
should be used for exporting a given glTF file. If @GlobalScope.OK, the export
will use this GLTFDocumentExtension instance. If not overridden,
@GlobalScope.OK is returned.

Error _export_preserialize(state: GLTFState) virtual

Part of the export process. This method is run after _export_post_convert()
and before _get_saveable_image_formats().

This method can be used to alter the state before performing serialization. It
runs every time when generating a buffer with GLTFDocument.generate_buffer()
or writing to the file system with GLTFDocument.write_to_filesystem().

Node3D _generate_scene_node(state: GLTFState, gltf_node: GLTFNode,
scene_parent: Node) virtual

Part of the import process. This method is run after _import_pre_generate()
and before _import_node().

Runs when generating a Godot scene node from a GLTFNode. The returned node
will be added to the scene tree. Multiple nodes can be generated in this step
if they are added as a child of the returned node.

Note: The `scene_parent` parameter may be `null` if this is the single root
node.

String _get_image_file_extension() virtual

Returns the file extension to use for saving image data into, for example,
`".png"`. If defined, when this extension is used to handle images, and the
images are saved to a separate file, the image bytes will be copied to a file
with this extension. If this is set, there should be a ResourceImporter class
able to import the file. If not defined or empty, Godot will save the image
into a PNG file.

PackedStringArray _get_saveable_image_formats() virtual

Part of the export process. This method is run after _convert_scene_node() and
before _export_node().

Returns an array of the image formats that can be saved/exported by this
extension. This extension will only be selected as the image exporter if the
GLTFDocument's GLTFDocument.image_format is in this array. If this
GLTFDocumentExtension is selected as the image exporter, one of the
_save_image_at_path() or _serialize_image_to_bytes() methods will run next,
otherwise _export_node() will run next. If the format name contains `"Lossy"`,
the lossy quality slider will be displayed.

PackedStringArray _get_supported_extensions() virtual

Part of the import process. This method is run after _import_preflight() and
before _parse_node_extensions().

Returns an array of the glTF extensions supported by this
GLTFDocumentExtension class. This is used to validate if a glTF file with
required extensions can be loaded.

Error _import_node(state: GLTFState, gltf_node: GLTFNode, json: Dictionary,
node: Node) virtual

Part of the import process. This method is run after _generate_scene_node()
and before _import_post().

This method can be used to make modifications to each of the generated Godot
scene nodes.

GLTFObjectModelProperty _import_object_model_property(state: GLTFState,
split_json_pointer: PackedStringArray, partial_paths: Array[NodePath]) virtual

Part of the import process. Allows GLTFDocumentExtension classes to provide
mappings for JSON pointers to glTF properties, as defined by the glTF object
model, to properties of nodes in the Godot scene tree.

Returns a GLTFObjectModelProperty instance that defines how the property
should be mapped. If your extension can't handle the property, return `null`
or an instance without any NodePaths (see
GLTFObjectModelProperty.has_node_paths()). You should use
GLTFObjectModelProperty.set_types() to set the types, and
GLTFObjectModelProperty.append_path_to_property() function is useful for most
simple cases.

In many cases, `partial_paths` will contain the start of a path, allowing the
extension to complete the path. For example, for
`/nodes/3/extensions/MY_ext/prop`, Godot will pass you a NodePath that leads
to node 3, so the GLTFDocumentExtension class only needs to resolve the last
`MY_ext/prop` part of the path. In this example, the extension should check
`split.size() > 4 and split[0] == "nodes" and split[2] == "extensions" and
split[3] == "MY_ext"` at the start of the function to check if this JSON
pointer applies to it, then it can use `partial_paths` and handle `split[4]`.

Error _import_post(state: GLTFState, root: Node) virtual

Part of the import process. This method is run last, after all other parts of
the import process.

This method can be used to modify the final Godot scene generated by the
import process.

Error _import_post_parse(state: GLTFState) virtual

Part of the import process. This method is run after _parse_node_extensions()
and before _import_pre_generate().

This method can be used to modify any of the data imported so far after
parsing each node, but before generating the scene or any of its nodes.

Error _import_pre_generate(state: GLTFState) virtual

Part of the import process. This method is run after _import_post_parse() and
before _generate_scene_node().

This method can be used to modify or read from any of the processed data
structures, before generating the nodes and then running the final per-node
import step.

Error _import_preflight(state: GLTFState, extensions: PackedStringArray)
virtual

Part of the import process. This method is run first, before all other parts
of the import process.

The return value is used to determine if this GLTFDocumentExtension instance
should be used for importing a given glTF file. If @GlobalScope.OK, the import
will use this GLTFDocumentExtension instance. If not overridden,
@GlobalScope.OK is returned.

Error _parse_image_data(state: GLTFState, image_data: PackedByteArray,
mime_type: String, ret_image: Image) virtual

Part of the import process. This method is run after _parse_node_extensions()
and before _parse_texture_json().

Runs when parsing image data from a glTF file. The data could be sourced from
a separate file, a URI, or a buffer, and then is passed as a byte array.

Error _parse_node_extensions(state: GLTFState, gltf_node: GLTFNode,
extensions: Dictionary) virtual

Part of the import process. This method is run after
_get_supported_extensions() and before _import_post_parse().

Runs when parsing the node extensions of a GLTFNode. This method can be used
to process the extension JSON data into a format that can be used by
_generate_scene_node(). The return value should be a member of the Error enum.

Error _parse_texture_json(state: GLTFState, texture_json: Dictionary,
ret_gltf_texture: GLTFTexture) virtual

Part of the import process. This method is run after _parse_image_data() and
before _generate_scene_node().

Runs when parsing the texture JSON from the glTF textures array. This can be
used to set the source image index to use as the texture.

Error _save_image_at_path(state: GLTFState, image: Image, file_path: String,
image_format: String, lossy_quality: float) virtual

Part of the export process. This method is run after
_get_saveable_image_formats() and before _serialize_texture_json().

This method is run when saving images separately from the glTF file. When
images are embedded, _serialize_image_to_bytes() runs instead. Note that these
methods only run when this GLTFDocumentExtension is selected as the image
exporter.

PackedByteArray _serialize_image_to_bytes(state: GLTFState, image: Image,
image_dict: Dictionary, image_format: String, lossy_quality: float) virtual

Part of the export process. This method is run after
_get_saveable_image_formats() and before _serialize_texture_json().

This method is run when embedding images in the glTF file. When images are
saved separately, _save_image_at_path() runs instead. Note that these methods
only run when this GLTFDocumentExtension is selected as the image exporter.

This method must set the image MIME type in the `image_dict` with the
`"mimeType"` key. For example, for a PNG image, it would be set to
`"image/png"`. The return value must be a PackedByteArray containing the image
data.

Error _serialize_texture_json(state: GLTFState, texture_json: Dictionary,
gltf_texture: GLTFTexture, image_format: String) virtual

Part of the export process. This method is run after _save_image_at_path() or
_serialize_image_to_bytes(), and before _export_node(). Note that this method
only runs when this GLTFDocumentExtension is selected as the image exporter.

This method can be used to set up the extensions for the texture JSON by
editing `texture_json`. The extension must also be added as used extension
with GLTFState.add_used_extension(), be sure to set `required` to `true` if
you are not providing a fallback.
