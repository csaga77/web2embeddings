# CurveXYZTexture

Inherits: Texture2D < Texture < Resource < RefCounted < Object

A 1D texture where the red, green, and blue color channels correspond to
points on 3 curves.

## Description

A 1D texture where the red, green, and blue color channels correspond to
points on 3 unit Curve resources. Compared to using separate CurveTextures,
this further simplifies the task of saving curves as image files.

If you only need to store one curve within a single texture, use CurveTexture
instead. See also GradientTexture1D and GradientTexture2D.

## Properties

Curve | curve_x  
---|---  
Curve | curve_y  
Curve | curve_z  
bool | resource_local_to_scene | `false` (overrides Resource)  
int | width | `256`  
  
## Property Descriptions

Curve curve_x

  * void set_curve_x(value: Curve)

  * Curve get_curve_x()

The Curve that is rendered onto the texture's red channel. Should be a unit
Curve.

Curve curve_y

  * void set_curve_y(value: Curve)

  * Curve get_curve_y()

The Curve that is rendered onto the texture's green channel. Should be a unit
Curve.

Curve curve_z

  * void set_curve_z(value: Curve)

  * Curve get_curve_z()

The Curve that is rendered onto the texture's blue channel. Should be a unit
Curve.

int width = `256`

  * void set_width(value: int)

  * int get_width()

The width of the texture (in pixels). Higher values make it possible to
represent high-frequency data better (such as sudden direction changes), at
the cost of increased generation time and memory usage.
