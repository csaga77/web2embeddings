# XRNode3D

Inherits: Node3D < Node < Object

Inherited By: XRAnchor3D, XRController3D

A 3D node that has its position automatically updated by the XRServer.

## Description

This node can be bound to a specific pose of a XRPositionalTracker and will
automatically have its Node3D.transform updated by the XRServer. Nodes of this
type must be added as children of the XROrigin3D node.

## Properties

StringName | pose | `&"default"`  
---|---|---  
bool | show_when_tracked | `false`  
StringName | tracker | `&""`  
  
## Methods

bool | get_has_tracking_data() const  
---|---  
bool | get_is_active() const  
XRPose | get_pose()  
void | trigger_haptic_pulse(action_name: String, frequency: float, amplitude: float, duration_sec: float, delay_sec: float)  
  
## Signals

tracking_changed(tracking: bool)

Emitted when the tracker starts or stops receiving updated tracking data for
the pose being tracked. The `tracking` argument indicates whether the tracker
is getting updated tracking data.

## Property Descriptions

StringName pose = `&"default"`

  * void set_pose_name(value: StringName)

  * StringName get_pose_name()

The name of the pose we're bound to. Which poses a tracker supports is not
known during design time.

Godot defines number of standard pose names such as `aim` and `grip` but other
may be configured within a given XRInterface.

bool show_when_tracked = `false`

  * void set_show_when_tracked(value: bool)

  * bool get_show_when_tracked()

Enables showing the node when tracking starts, and hiding the node when
tracking is lost.

StringName tracker = `&""`

  * void set_tracker(value: StringName)

  * StringName get_tracker()

The name of the tracker we're bound to. Which trackers are available is not
known during design time.

Godot defines a number of standard trackers such as `left_hand` and
`right_hand` but others may be configured within a given XRInterface.

## Method Descriptions

bool get_has_tracking_data() const

Returns `true` if the tracker has current tracking data for the pose being
tracked.

bool get_is_active() const

Returns `true` if the tracker has been registered and the pose is being
tracked.

XRPose get_pose()

Returns the XRPose containing the current state of the pose being tracked.
This gives access to additional properties of this pose.

void trigger_haptic_pulse(action_name: String, frequency: float, amplitude:
float, duration_sec: float, delay_sec: float)

Triggers a haptic pulse on a device associated with this interface.

`action_name` is the name of the action for this pulse.

`frequency` is the frequency of the pulse, set to `0.0` to have the system use
a default frequency.

`amplitude` is the amplitude of the pulse between `0.0` and `1.0`.

`duration_sec` is the duration of the pulse in seconds.

`delay_sec` is a delay in seconds before the pulse is given.
