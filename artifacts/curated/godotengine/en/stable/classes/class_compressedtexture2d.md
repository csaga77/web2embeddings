# CompressedTexture2D

Inherits: Texture2D < Texture < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Texture with 2 dimensions, optionally compressed.

## Description

A texture that is loaded from a `.ctex` file. This file format is internal to
Godot; it is created by importing other image formats with the import system.
CompressedTexture2D can use one of 4 compression methods (including a lack of
any compression):

  * Lossless (WebP or PNG, uncompressed on the GPU)

  * Lossy (WebP, uncompressed on the GPU)

  * VRAM Compressed (compressed on the GPU)

  * VRAM Uncompressed (uncompressed on the GPU)

  * Basis Universal (compressed on the GPU. Lower file sizes than VRAM Compressed, but slower to compress and lower quality than VRAM Compressed)

Only VRAM Compressed actually reduces the memory usage on the GPU. The
Lossless and Lossy compression methods will reduce the required storage on
disk, but they will not reduce memory usage on the GPU as the texture is sent
to the GPU uncompressed.

Using VRAM Compressed also improves loading times, as VRAM-compressed textures
are faster to load compared to textures using lossless or lossy compression.
VRAM compression can exhibit noticeable artifacts and is intended to be used
for 3D rendering, not 2D.
