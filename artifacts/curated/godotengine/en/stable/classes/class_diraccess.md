# DirAccess

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Provides methods for managing directories and their content.

## Description

This class is used to manage directories and their content, even outside of
the project folder.

DirAccess can't be instantiated directly. Instead it is created with a static
method that takes a path for which it will be opened.

Most of the methods have a static alternative that can be used without
creating a DirAccess. Static methods only support absolute paths (including
`res://` and `user://`).

    
    
    # Standard
    var dir = DirAccess.open("user://levels")
    dir.make_dir("world1")
    # Static
    DirAccess.make_dir_absolute("user://levels/world1")
    

Note: Accessing project ("res://") directories once exported may behave
unexpectedly as some files are converted to engine-specific formats and their
original source files may not be present in the expected PCK package. Because
of this, to access resources in an exported project, it is recommended to use
ResourceLoader instead of FileAccess.

Here is an example on how to iterate through the files of a directory:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    func dir_contents(path):
        var dir = DirAccess.open(path)
        if dir:
            dir.list_dir_begin()
            var file_name = dir.get_next()
            while file_name != "":
                if dir.current_is_dir():
                    print("Found directory: " + file_name)
                else:
                    print("Found file: " + file_name)
                file_name = dir.get_next()
        else:
            print("An error occurred when trying to access the path.")
    
    
    
    public void DirContents(string path)
    {
        using var dir = DirAccess.Open(path);
        if (dir != null)
        {
            dir.ListDirBegin();
            string fileName = dir.GetNext();
            while (fileName != "")
            {
                if (dir.CurrentIsDir())
                {
                    GD.Print($"Found directory: {fileName}");
                }
                else
                {
                    GD.Print($"Found file: {fileName}");
                }
                fileName = dir.GetNext();
            }
        }
        else
        {
            GD.Print("An error occurred when trying to access the path.");
        }
    }
    

Keep in mind that file names may change or be remapped after export. If you
want to see the actual resource file list as it appears in the editor, use
ResourceLoader.list_directory() instead.

## Property Descriptions

bool include_hidden

  * void set_include_hidden(value: bool)

  * bool get_include_hidden()

If `true`, hidden files are included when navigating the directory.

Affects list_dir_begin(), get_directories() and get_files().

bool include_navigational

  * void set_include_navigational(value: bool)

  * bool get_include_navigational()

If `true`, `.` and `..` are included when navigating the directory.

Affects list_dir_begin() and get_directories().

## Method Descriptions

Error change_dir(to_dir: String)

Changes the currently opened directory to the one passed as an argument. The
argument can be relative to the current directory (e.g. `newdir` or
`../newdir`), or an absolute path (e.g. `/tmp/newdir` or
`res://somedir/newdir`).

Returns one of the Error code constants (@GlobalScope.OK on success).

Note: The new directory must be within the same scope, e.g. when you had
opened a directory inside `res://`, you can't change it to `user://`
directory. If you need to open a directory in another access scope, use open()
to create a new instance instead.

Error copy(from: String, to: String, chmod_flags: int = -1)

Copies the `from` file to the `to` destination. Both arguments should be paths
to files, either relative or absolute. If the destination file exists and is
not access-protected, it will be overwritten.

If `chmod_flags` is different than `-1`, the Unix permissions for the
destination path will be set to the provided value, if available on the
current operating system.

Returns one of the Error code constants (@GlobalScope.OK on success).

Error copy_absolute(from: String, to: String, chmod_flags: int = -1) static

Static version of copy(). Supports only absolute paths.

Error create_link(source: String, target: String)

Creates symbolic link between files or folders.

Note: On Windows, this method works only if the application is running with
elevated privileges or Developer Mode is enabled.

Note: This method is implemented on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

DirAccess create_temp(prefix: String = "", keep: bool = false) static

Creates a temporary directory. This directory will be freed when the returned
DirAccess is freed.

If `prefix` is not empty, it will be prefixed to the directory name, separated
by a `-`.

If `keep` is `true`, the directory is not deleted when the returned DirAccess
is freed.

Returns `null` if opening the directory failed. You can use get_open_error()
to check the error that occurred.

bool current_is_dir() const

Returns whether the current item processed with the last get_next() call is a
directory (`.` and `..` are considered directories).

bool dir_exists(path: String)

Returns whether the target directory exists. The argument can be relative to
the current directory, or an absolute path.

Note: The returned bool in the editor and after exporting when used on a path
in the `res://` directory may be different. Some files are converted to
engine-specific formats when exported, potentially changing the directory
structure.

bool dir_exists_absolute(path: String) static

Static version of dir_exists(). Supports only absolute paths.

Note: The returned bool in the editor and after exporting when used on a path
in the `res://` directory may be different. Some files are converted to
engine-specific formats when exported, potentially changing the directory
structure.

bool file_exists(path: String)

Returns whether the target file exists. The argument can be relative to the
current directory, or an absolute path.

For a static equivalent, use FileAccess.file_exists().

Note: Many resources types are imported (e.g. textures or sound files), and
their source asset will not be included in the exported game, as only the
imported version is used. See ResourceLoader.exists() for an alternative
approach that takes resource remapping into account.

String get_current_dir(include_drive: bool = true) const

Returns the absolute path to the currently opened directory (e.g.
`res://folder` or `C:\tmp\folder`).

int get_current_drive()

Returns the currently opened directory's drive index. See get_drive_name() to
convert returned index to the name of the drive.

PackedStringArray get_directories()

Returns a PackedStringArray containing filenames of the directory contents,
excluding files. The array is sorted alphabetically.

Affected by include_hidden and include_navigational.

Note: The returned directories in the editor and after exporting in the
`res://` directory may differ as some files are converted to engine-specific
formats when exported.

PackedStringArray get_directories_at(path: String) static

Returns a PackedStringArray containing filenames of the directory contents,
excluding files, at the given `path`. The array is sorted alphabetically.

Use get_directories() if you want more control of what gets included.

Note: The returned directories in the editor and after exporting in the
`res://` directory may differ as some files are converted to engine-specific
formats when exported.

int get_drive_count() static

On Windows, returns the number of drives (partitions) mounted on the current
filesystem.

On macOS, returns the number of mounted volumes.

On Linux, returns the number of mounted volumes and GTK 3 bookmarks.

On other platforms, the method returns 0.

String get_drive_name(idx: int) static

On Windows, returns the name of the drive (partition) passed as an argument
(e.g. `C:`).

On macOS, returns the path to the mounted volume passed as an argument.

On Linux, returns the path to the mounted volume or GTK 3 bookmark passed as
an argument.

On other platforms, or if the requested drive does not exist, the method
returns an empty String.

PackedStringArray get_files()

Returns a PackedStringArray containing filenames of the directory contents,
excluding directories. The array is sorted alphabetically.

Affected by include_hidden.

Note: When used on a `res://` path in an exported project, only the files
actually included in the PCK at the given folder level are returned. In
practice, this means that since imported resources are stored in a top-level
`.godot/` folder, only paths to `*.gd` and `*.import` files are returned (plus
a few files such as `project.godot` or `project.binary` and the project icon).
In an exported project, the list of returned files will also vary depending on
whether ProjectSettings.editor/export/convert_text_resources_to_binary is
`true`.

PackedStringArray get_files_at(path: String) static

Returns a PackedStringArray containing filenames of the directory contents,
excluding directories, at the given `path`. The array is sorted
alphabetically.

Use get_files() if you want more control of what gets included.

Note: When used on a `res://` path in an exported project, only the files
included in the PCK at the given folder level are returned. In practice, this
means that since imported resources are stored in a top-level `.godot/`
folder, only paths to `.gd` and `.import` files are returned (plus a few other
files, such as `project.godot` or `project.binary` and the project icon). In
an exported project, the list of returned files will also vary depending on
ProjectSettings.editor/export/convert_text_resources_to_binary.

String get_next()

Returns the next element (file or directory) in the current directory.

The name of the file or directory is returned (and not its full path). Once
the stream has been fully processed, the method returns an empty String and
closes the stream automatically (i.e. list_dir_end() would not be mandatory in
such a case).

Error get_open_error() static

Returns the result of the last open() call in the current thread.

int get_space_left()

Returns the available space on the current directory's disk, in bytes. Returns
`0` if the platform-specific method to query the available space fails.

bool is_bundle(path: String) const

Returns `true` if the directory is a macOS bundle.

Note: This method is implemented on macOS.

bool is_case_sensitive(path: String) const

Returns `true` if the file system or directory use case sensitive file names.

Note: This method is implemented on macOS, Linux (for EXT4 and F2FS
filesystems only) and Windows. On other platforms, it always returns `true`.

bool is_link(path: String)

Returns `true` if the file or directory is a symbolic link, directory
junction, or other reparse point.

Note: This method is implemented on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

Error list_dir_begin()

Initializes the stream used to list all files and directories using the
get_next() function, closing the currently opened stream if needed. Once the
stream has been processed, it should typically be closed with list_dir_end().

Affected by include_hidden and include_navigational.

Note: The order of files and directories returned by this method is not
deterministic, and can vary between operating systems. If you want a list of
all files or folders sorted alphabetically, use get_files() or
get_directories().

void list_dir_end()

Closes the current stream opened with list_dir_begin() (whether it has been
fully processed with get_next() does not matter).

Error make_dir(path: String)

Creates a directory. The argument can be relative to the current directory, or
an absolute path. The target directory should be placed in an already existing
directory (to create the full path recursively, see make_dir_recursive()).

Returns one of the Error code constants (@GlobalScope.OK on success).

Error make_dir_absolute(path: String) static

Static version of make_dir(). Supports only absolute paths.

Error make_dir_recursive(path: String)

Creates a target directory and all necessary intermediate directories in its
path, by calling make_dir() recursively. The argument can be relative to the
current directory, or an absolute path.

Returns one of the Error code constants (@GlobalScope.OK on success).

Error make_dir_recursive_absolute(path: String) static

Static version of make_dir_recursive(). Supports only absolute paths.

DirAccess open(path: String) static

Creates a new DirAccess object and opens an existing directory of the
filesystem. The `path` argument can be within the project tree
(`res://folder`), the user directory (`user://folder`) or an absolute path of
the user filesystem (e.g. `/tmp/folder` or `C:\tmp\folder`).

Returns `null` if opening the directory failed. You can use get_open_error()
to check the error that occurred.

String read_link(path: String)

Returns target of the symbolic link.

Note: This method is implemented on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

Error remove(path: String)

Permanently deletes the target file or an empty directory. The argument can be
relative to the current directory, or an absolute path. If the target
directory is not empty, the operation will fail.

If you don't want to delete the file/directory permanently, use
OS.move_to_trash() instead.

Returns one of the Error code constants (@GlobalScope.OK on success).

Error remove_absolute(path: String) static

Static version of remove(). Supports only absolute paths.

Error rename(from: String, to: String)

Renames (move) the `from` file or directory to the `to` destination. Both
arguments should be paths to files or directories, either relative or
absolute. If the destination file or directory exists and is not access-
protected, it will be overwritten.

Returns one of the Error code constants (@GlobalScope.OK on success).

Error rename_absolute(from: String, to: String) static

Static version of rename(). Supports only absolute paths.
