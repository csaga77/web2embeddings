# VisualShaderNodeCubemap

Inherits: VisualShaderNode < Resource < RefCounted < Object

A Cubemap sampling node to be used within the visual shader graph.

## Description

Translated to `texture(cubemap, vec3)` in the shader language. Returns a color
vector and alpha channel as scalar.

## Properties

TextureLayered | cube_map  
---|---  
Source | source | `0`  
TextureType | texture_type | `0`  
  
## Enumerations

enum Source:

Source SOURCE_TEXTURE = `0`

Use the Cubemap set via cube_map. If this is set to source, the `samplerCube`
port is ignored.

Source SOURCE_PORT = `1`

Use the Cubemap sampler reference passed via the `samplerCube` port. If this
is set to source, the cube_map texture is ignored.

Source SOURCE_MAX = `2`

Represents the size of the Source enum.

enum TextureType:

TextureType TYPE_DATA = `0`

No hints are added to the uniform declaration.

TextureType TYPE_COLOR = `1`

Adds `source_color` as hint to the uniform declaration for proper sRGB to
linear conversion.

TextureType TYPE_NORMAL_MAP = `2`

Adds `hint_normal` as hint to the uniform declaration, which internally
converts the texture for proper usage as normal map.

TextureType TYPE_MAX = `3`

Represents the size of the TextureType enum.

## Property Descriptions

TextureLayered cube_map

  * void set_cube_map(value: TextureLayered)

  * TextureLayered get_cube_map()

The Cubemap texture to sample when using SOURCE_TEXTURE as source.

Source source = `0`

  * void set_source(value: Source)

  * Source get_source()

Defines which source should be used for the sampling. See Source for options.

TextureType texture_type = `0`

  * void set_texture_type(value: TextureType)

  * TextureType get_texture_type()

Defines the type of data provided by the source texture. See TextureType for
options.
