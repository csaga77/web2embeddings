# VisualShaderNodeFloatOp

Inherits: VisualShaderNode < Resource < RefCounted < Object

A floating-point scalar operator to be used within the visual shader graph.

## Description

Applies operator to two floating-point inputs: `a` and `b`.

## Properties

Operator | operator | `0`  
---|---|---  
  
## Enumerations

enum Operator:

Operator OP_ADD = `0`

Sums two numbers using `a + b`.

Operator OP_SUB = `1`

Subtracts two numbers using `a - b`.

Operator OP_MUL = `2`

Multiplies two numbers using `a * b`.

Operator OP_DIV = `3`

Divides two numbers using `a / b`.

Operator OP_MOD = `4`

Calculates the remainder of two numbers. Translates to `mod(a, b)` in the
Godot Shader Language.

Operator OP_POW = `5`

Raises the `a` to the power of `b`. Translates to `pow(a, b)` in the Godot
Shader Language.

Operator OP_MAX = `6`

Returns the greater of two numbers. Translates to `max(a, b)` in the Godot
Shader Language.

Operator OP_MIN = `7`

Returns the lesser of two numbers. Translates to `min(a, b)` in the Godot
Shader Language.

Operator OP_ATAN2 = `8`

Returns the arc-tangent of the parameters. Translates to `atan(a, b)` in the
Godot Shader Language.

Operator OP_STEP = `9`

Generates a step function by comparing `b`(x) to `a`(edge). Returns 0.0 if `x`
is smaller than `edge` and otherwise 1.0. Translates to `step(a, b)` in the
Godot Shader Language.

Operator OP_ENUM_SIZE = `10`

Represents the size of the Operator enum.

## Property Descriptions

Operator operator = `0`

  * void set_operator(value: Operator)

  * Operator get_operator()

An operator to be applied to the inputs. See Operator for options.
