# GDExtension

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

A native library for GDExtension.

## Description

The GDExtension resource type represents a shared library which can expand the
functionality of the engine. The GDExtensionManager singleton is responsible
for loading, reloading, and unloading GDExtension resources.

Note: GDExtension itself is not a scripting language and has no relation to
GDScript resources.

bool | is_library_open() const  
  
## Enumerations

enum InitializationLevel:

InitializationLevel INITIALIZATION_LEVEL_CORE = `0`

The library is initialized at the same time as the core features of the
engine.

InitializationLevel INITIALIZATION_LEVEL_SERVERS = `1`

The library is initialized at the same time as the engine's servers (such as
RenderingServer or PhysicsServer3D).

The library is initialized at the same time as the engine's scene-related
classes.

InitializationLevel INITIALIZATION_LEVEL_EDITOR = `3`

The library is initialized at the same time as the engine's editor classes.
Only happens when loading the GDExtension in the editor.
