# ImageTexture

Inherits: Texture2D < Texture < Resource < RefCounted < Object

A Texture2D based on an Image.

## Description

A Texture2D based on an Image. For an image to be displayed, an ImageTexture
has to be created from it using the create_from_image() method:

    
    
    var image = Image.load_from_file("res://icon.svg")
    var texture = ImageTexture.create_from_image(image)
    $Sprite2D.texture = texture
    

This way, textures can be created at run-time by loading images both from
within the editor and externally.

Warning: Prefer to load imported textures with @GDScript.load() over loading
them from within the filesystem dynamically with Image.load(), as it may not
work in exported projects:

    
    
    var texture = load("res://icon.svg")
    $Sprite2D.texture = texture
    

This is because images have to be imported as a CompressedTexture2D first to
be loaded with @GDScript.load(). If you'd still like to load an image file
just like any other Resource, import it as an Image resource instead, and then
load it normally using the @GDScript.load() method.

Note: The image can be retrieved from an imported texture using the
Texture2D.get_image() method, which returns a copy of the image:

    
    
    var texture = load("res://icon.svg")
    var image = texture.get_image()
    

An ImageTexture is not meant to be operated from within the editor interface
directly, and is mostly useful for rendering images on screen dynamically via
code. If you need to generate images procedurally from within the editor,
consider saving and importing images as custom texture resources implementing
a new EditorImportPlugin.

Note: The maximum texture size is 1638416384 pixels due to graphics hardware
limitations.

## Method Descriptions

ImageTexture create_from_image(image: Image) static

Creates a new ImageTexture and initializes it by allocating and setting the
data from an Image.

Format get_format() const

Returns the format of the texture, one of Format.

void set_image(image: Image)

Replaces the texture's data with a new Image. This will re-allocate new memory
for the texture.

If you want to update the image, but don't need to change its parameters
(format, size), use update() instead for better performance.

void set_size_override(size: Vector2i)

Resizes the texture to the specified dimensions.

void update(image: Image)

Replaces the texture's data with a new Image.

Note: The texture has to be created using create_from_image() or initialized
first with the set_image() method before it can be updated. The new image
dimensions, format, and mipmaps configuration should match the existing
texture's image configuration.

Use this method over set_image() if you need to update the texture frequently,
which is faster than allocating additional memory for a new texture each time.
