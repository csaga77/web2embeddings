Abstract base class for 2D game objects affected by physics.

## Description

PhysicsBody2D is an abstract base class for 2D game objects affected by
physics. All 2D physics bodies inherit from it.

## Method Descriptions

void add_collision_exception_with(body: Node)

Adds a body to the list of bodies that this body can't collide with.

Array[PhysicsBody2D] get_collision_exceptions()

Returns an array of nodes that were added as collision exceptions for this
body.

Vector2 get_gravity() const

Returns the gravity vector computed from all sources that can affect the body,
including all gravity overrides from Area2D nodes and the global world
gravity.

KinematicCollision2D move_and_collide(motion: Vector2, test_only: bool =
false, safe_margin: float = 0.08, recovery_as_collision: bool = false)

Moves the body along the vector `motion`. In order to be frame rate
independent in Node._physics_process() or Node._process(), `motion` should be
computed using `delta`.

Returns a KinematicCollision2D, which contains information about the collision
when stopped, or when touching another body along the motion.

If `test_only` is `true`, the body does not move but the would-be collision
information is given.

`safe_margin` is the extra margin used for collision recovery (see
CharacterBody2D.safe_margin for more details).

If `recovery_as_collision` is `true`, any depenetration from the recovery
phase is also reported as a collision; this is used e.g. by CharacterBody2D
for improving floor detection during floor snapping.

void remove_collision_exception_with(body: Node)

Removes a body from the list of bodies that this body can't collide with.

bool test_move(from: Transform2D, motion: Vector2, collision:
KinematicCollision2D = null, safe_margin: float = 0.08, recovery_as_collision:
bool = false)

Checks for collisions without moving the body. In order to be frame rate
independent in Node._physics_process() or Node._process(), `motion` should be
computed using `delta`.

Virtually sets the node's position, scale and rotation to that of the given
Transform2D, then tries to move the body along the vector `motion`. Returns
`true` if a collision would stop the body from moving along the whole path.

`collision` is an optional object of type KinematicCollision2D, which contains
additional information about the collision when stopped, or when touching
another body along the motion.

`safe_margin` is the extra margin used for collision recovery (see
CharacterBody2D.safe_margin for more details).

If `recovery_as_collision` is `true`, any depenetration from the recovery
phase is also reported as a collision; this is useful for checking whether the
body would touch any other bodies.
