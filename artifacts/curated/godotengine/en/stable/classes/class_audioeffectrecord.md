# AudioEffectRecord

Inherits: AudioEffect < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Audio effect used for recording the sound from an audio bus.

## Description

Allows the user to record the sound from an audio bus into an AudioStreamWAV.
When used on the "Master" audio bus, this includes all audio output by Godot.

Unlike AudioEffectCapture, this effect encodes the recording with the given
format (8-bit, 16-bit, or compressed) instead of giving access to the raw
audio samples.

Can be used (with an AudioStreamMicrophone) to record from a microphone.

Note: ProjectSettings.audio/driver/enable_input must be `true` for audio input
to work. See also that setting's description for caveats related to
permissions and operating system privacy settings.
