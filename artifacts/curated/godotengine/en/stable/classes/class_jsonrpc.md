# JSONRPC

Inherits: Object

A helper to handle dictionaries which look like JSONRPC documents.

## Description

JSON-RPC is a standard which wraps a method call in a JSON object. The object
has a particular structure and identifies which method is called, the
parameters to that function, and carries an ID to keep track of responses.
This class implements that standard on top of Dictionary; you will have to
convert between a Dictionary and JSON with other functions.

## Methods

Dictionary | make_notification(method: String, params: Variant)  
---|---  
Dictionary | make_request(method: String, params: Variant, id: Variant)  
Dictionary | make_response(result: Variant, id: Variant)  
Dictionary | make_response_error(code: int, message: String, id: Variant = null) const  
Variant | process_action(action: Variant, recurse: bool = false)  
String | process_string(action: String)  
void | set_scope(scope: String, target: Object)  
  
## Enumerations

enum ErrorCode:

ErrorCode PARSE_ERROR = `-32700`

The request could not be parsed as it was not valid by JSON standard
(JSON.parse() failed).

ErrorCode INVALID_REQUEST = `-32600`

A method call was requested but the request's format is not valid.

ErrorCode METHOD_NOT_FOUND = `-32601`

A method call was requested but no function of that name existed in the
JSONRPC subclass.

ErrorCode INVALID_PARAMS = `-32602`

A method call was requested but the given method parameters are not valid. Not
used by the built-in JSONRPC.

ErrorCode INTERNAL_ERROR = `-32603`

An internal error occurred while processing the request. Not used by the
built-in JSONRPC.

## Method Descriptions

Dictionary make_notification(method: String, params: Variant)

Returns a dictionary in the form of a JSON-RPC notification. Notifications are
one-shot messages which do not expect a response.

  * `method`: Name of the method being called.

  * `params`: An array or dictionary of parameters being passed to the method.

Dictionary make_request(method: String, params: Variant, id: Variant)

Returns a dictionary in the form of a JSON-RPC request. Requests are sent to a
server with the expectation of a response. The ID field is used for the server
to specify which exact request it is responding to.

  * `method`: Name of the method being called.

  * `params`: An array or dictionary of parameters being passed to the method.

  * `id`: Uniquely identifies this request. The server is expected to send a response with the same ID.

Dictionary make_response(result: Variant, id: Variant)

When a server has received and processed a request, it is expected to send a
response. If you did not want a response then you need to have sent a
Notification instead.

  * `result`: The return value of the function which was called.

  * `id`: The ID of the request this response is targeted to.

Dictionary make_response_error(code: int, message: String, id: Variant = null)
const

Creates a response which indicates a previous reply has failed in some way.

  * `code`: The error code corresponding to what kind of error this is. See the ErrorCode constants.

  * `message`: A custom message about this error.

  * `id`: The request this error is a response to.

Variant process_action(action: Variant, recurse: bool = false)

Given a Dictionary which takes the form of a JSON-RPC request: unpack the
request and run it. Methods are resolved by looking at the field called
"method" and looking for an equivalently named function in the JSONRPC object.
If one is found that method is called.

To add new supported methods extend the JSONRPC class and call
process_action() on your subclass.

`action`: The action to be run, as a Dictionary in the form of a JSON-RPC
request or notification.
