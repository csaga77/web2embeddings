# LightOccluder2D

Inherits: Node2D < CanvasItem < Node < Object

Occludes light cast by a Light2D, casting shadows.

## Description

Occludes light cast by a Light2D, casting shadows. The LightOccluder2D must be
provided with an OccluderPolygon2D in order for the shadow to be computed.

## Tutorials

  * 2D lights and shadows

## Properties

OccluderPolygon2D | occluder  
---|---  
int | occluder_light_mask | `1`  
bool | sdf_collision | `true`  
  
## Property Descriptions

OccluderPolygon2D occluder

  * void set_occluder_polygon(value: OccluderPolygon2D)

  * OccluderPolygon2D get_occluder_polygon()

The OccluderPolygon2D used to compute the shadow.

int occluder_light_mask = `1`

  * void set_occluder_light_mask(value: int)

  * int get_occluder_light_mask()

The LightOccluder2D's occluder light mask. The LightOccluder2D will cast
shadows only from Light2D(s) that have the same light mask(s).

bool sdf_collision = `true`

  * void set_as_sdf_collision(value: bool)

  * bool is_set_as_sdf_collision()

If enabled, the occluder will be part of a real-time generated signed distance
field that can be used in custom shaders.
