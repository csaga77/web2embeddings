# SkeletonModification2DFABRIK

Experimental: This class may be changed or removed in future versions.

Inherits: SkeletonModification2D < Resource < RefCounted < Object

A modification that uses FABRIK to manipulate a series of Bone2D nodes to
reach a target.

## Description

This SkeletonModification2D uses an algorithm called Forward And Backward
Reaching Inverse Kinematics, or FABRIK, to rotate a bone chain so that it
reaches a target.

FABRIK works by knowing the positions and lengths of a series of bones,
typically called a "bone chain". It first starts by running a forward pass,
which places the final bone at the target's position. Then all other bones are
moved towards the tip bone, so they stay at the defined bone length away. Then
a backwards pass is performed, where the root/first bone in the FABRIK chain
is placed back at the origin. Then all other bones are moved so they stay at
the defined bone length away. This positions the bone chain so that it reaches
the target when possible, but all of the bones stay the correct length away
from each other.

Because of how FABRIK works, it often gives more natural results than those
seen in SkeletonModification2DCCDIK. FABRIK also supports angle constraints,
which are fully taken into account when solving.

Note: The FABRIK modifier has `fabrik_joints`, which are the data objects that
hold the data for each joint in the FABRIK chain. This is different from
Bone2D nodes! FABRIK joints hold the data needed for each Bone2D in the bone
chain used by FABRIK.

To help control how the FABRIK joints move, a magnet vector can be passed,
which can nudge the bones in a certain direction prior to solving, giving a
level of control over the final result.

## Property Descriptions

int fabrik_data_chain_length = `0`

  * void set_fabrik_data_chain_length(value: int)

  * int get_fabrik_data_chain_length()

The number of FABRIK joints in the FABRIK modification.

NodePath target_nodepath = `NodePath("")`

  * void set_target_node(value: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_target_node()

The NodePath to the node that is the target for the FABRIK modification. This
node is what the FABRIK chain will attempt to rotate the bone chain to.

## Method Descriptions

NodePath get_fabrik_joint_bone2d_node(joint_idx: int) const

Returns the Bone2D node assigned to the FABRIK joint at `joint_idx`.

int get_fabrik_joint_bone_index(joint_idx: int) const

Returns the index of the Bone2D node assigned to the FABRIK joint at
`joint_idx`.

Vector2 get_fabrik_joint_magnet_position(joint_idx: int) const

Returns the magnet position vector for the joint at `joint_idx`.

bool get_fabrik_joint_use_target_rotation(joint_idx: int) const

Returns whether the joint is using the target's rotation rather than allowing
FABRIK to rotate the joint. This option only applies to the tip/final joint in
the chain.

void set_fabrik_joint_bone2d_node(joint_idx: int, bone2d_nodepath: NodePath)

Sets the Bone2D node assigned to the FABRIK joint at `joint_idx`.

void set_fabrik_joint_bone_index(joint_idx: int, bone_idx: int)

Sets the bone index, `bone_idx`, of the FABRIK joint at `joint_idx`. When
possible, this will also update the `bone2d_node` of the FABRIK joint based on
data provided by the linked skeleton.

void set_fabrik_joint_magnet_position(joint_idx: int, magnet_position:
Vector2)

Sets the magnet position vector for the joint at `joint_idx`.

void set_fabrik_joint_use_target_rotation(joint_idx: int, use_target_rotation:
bool)

Sets whether the joint at `joint_idx` will use the target node's rotation
rather than letting FABRIK rotate the node.

Note: This option only works for the tip/final joint in the chain. For all
other nodes, this option will be ignored.
