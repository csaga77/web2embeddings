# Curve3D

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

Describes a Bzier curve in 3D space.

## Description

This class describes a Bzier curve in 3D space. It is mainly used to give a
shape to a Path3D, but can be manually sampled for other purposes.

It keeps a cache of precalculated points along the curve, to speed up further
calculations.

## Property Descriptions

float bake_interval = `0.2`

  * void set_bake_interval(value: float)

  * float get_bake_interval()

The distance in meters between two adjacent cached points. Changing it forces
the cache to be recomputed the next time the get_baked_points() or
get_baked_length() function is called. The smaller the distance, the more
points in the cache and the more memory it will consume, so use with care.

bool closed = `false`

  * void set_closed(value: bool)

  * bool is_closed()

If `true`, and the curve has more than 2 control points, the last point and
the first one will be connected in a loop.

int point_count = `0`

  * void set_point_count(value: int)

  * int get_point_count()

The number of points describing the curve.

bool up_vector_enabled = `true`

  * void set_up_vector_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_up_vector_enabled()

If `true`, the curve will bake up vectors used for orientation. This is used
when PathFollow3D.rotation_mode is set to PathFollow3D.ROTATION_ORIENTED.
Changing it forces the cache to be recomputed.

## Method Descriptions

void add_point(position: Vector3, in: Vector3 = Vector3(0, 0, 0), out: Vector3
= Vector3(0, 0, 0), index: int = -1)

Adds a point with the specified `position` relative to the curve's own
position, with control points `in` and `out`. Appends the new point at the end
of the point list.

If `index` is given, the new point is inserted before the existing point
identified by index `index`. Every existing point starting from `index` is
shifted further down the list of points. The index must be greater than or
equal to `0` and must not exceed the number of existing points in the line.
See point_count.

void clear_points()

Removes all points from the curve.

float get_baked_length() const

Returns the total length of the curve, based on the cached points. Given
enough density (see bake_interval), it should be approximate enough.

PackedVector3Array get_baked_points() const

Returns the cache of points as a PackedVector3Array.

PackedFloat32Array get_baked_tilts() const

Returns the cache of tilts as a PackedFloat32Array.

PackedVector3Array get_baked_up_vectors() const

Returns the cache of up vectors as a PackedVector3Array.

If up_vector_enabled is `false`, the cache will be empty.

float get_closest_offset(to_point: Vector3) const

Returns the closest offset to `to_point`. This offset is meant to be used in
sample_baked() or sample_baked_up_vector().

`to_point` must be in this curve's local space.

Vector3 get_closest_point(to_point: Vector3) const

Returns the closest point on baked segments (in curve's local space) to
`to_point`.

`to_point` must be in this curve's local space.

Vector3 get_point_in(idx: int) const

Returns the position of the control point leading to the vertex `idx`. The
returned position is relative to the vertex `idx`. If the index is out of
bounds, the function sends an error to the console, and returns `(0, 0, 0)`.

Vector3 get_point_out(idx: int) const

Returns the position of the control point leading out of the vertex `idx`. The
returned position is relative to the vertex `idx`. If the index is out of
bounds, the function sends an error to the console, and returns `(0, 0, 0)`.

Vector3 get_point_position(idx: int) const

Returns the position of the vertex `idx`. If the index is out of bounds, the
function sends an error to the console, and returns `(0, 0, 0)`.

float get_point_tilt(idx: int) const

Returns the tilt angle in radians for the point `idx`. If the index is out of
bounds, the function sends an error to the console, and returns `0`.

void remove_point(idx: int)

Deletes the point `idx` from the curve. Sends an error to the console if `idx`
is out of bounds.

Vector3 sample(idx: int, t: float) const

Returns the position between the vertex `idx` and the vertex `idx + 1`, where
`t` controls if the point is the first vertex (`t = 0.0`), the last vertex (`t
= 1.0`), or in between. Values of `t` outside the range (`0.0 >= t <=1`) give
strange, but predictable results.

If `idx` is out of bounds it is truncated to the first or last vertex, and `t`
is ignored. If the curve has no points, the function sends an error to the
console, and returns `(0, 0, 0)`.

Vector3 sample_baked(offset: float = 0.0, cubic: bool = false) const

Returns a point within the curve at position `offset`, where `offset` is
measured as a distance in 3D units along the curve. To do that, it finds the
two cached points where the `offset` lies between, then interpolates the
values. This interpolation is cubic if `cubic` is set to `true`, or linear if
set to `false`.

Cubic interpolation tends to follow the curves better, but linear is faster
(and often, precise enough).

Vector3 sample_baked_up_vector(offset: float, apply_tilt: bool = false) const

Returns an up vector within the curve at position `offset`, where `offset` is
measured as a distance in 3D units along the curve. To do that, it finds the
two cached up vectors where the `offset` lies between, then interpolates the
values. If `apply_tilt` is `true`, an interpolated tilt is applied to the
interpolated up vector.

If the curve has no up vectors, the function sends an error to the console,
and returns `(0, 1, 0)`.

Transform3D sample_baked_with_rotation(offset: float = 0.0, cubic: bool =
false, apply_tilt: bool = false) const

Returns a Transform3D with `origin` as point position, `basis.x` as sideway
vector, `basis.y` as up vector, `basis.z` as forward vector. When the curve
length is 0, there is no reasonable way to calculate the rotation, all vectors
aligned with global space axes. See also sample_baked().

Vector3 samplef(fofs: float) const

Returns the position at the vertex `fofs`. It calls sample() using the integer
part of `fofs` as `idx`, and its fractional part as `t`.

void set_point_in(idx: int, position: Vector3)

Sets the position of the control point leading to the vertex `idx`. If the
index is out of bounds, the function sends an error to the console. The
position is relative to the vertex.

void set_point_out(idx: int, position: Vector3)

Sets the position of the control point leading out of the vertex `idx`. If the
index is out of bounds, the function sends an error to the console. The
position is relative to the vertex.

void set_point_position(idx: int, position: Vector3)

Sets the position for the vertex `idx`. If the index is out of bounds, the
function sends an error to the console.

void set_point_tilt(idx: int, tilt: float)

Sets the tilt angle in radians for the point `idx`. If the index is out of
bounds, the function sends an error to the console.

The tilt controls the rotation along the look-at axis an object traveling the
path would have. In the case of a curve controlling a PathFollow3D, this tilt
is an offset over the natural tilt the PathFollow3D calculates.

PackedVector3Array tessellate(max_stages: int = 5, tolerance_degrees: float =
4) const

Returns a list of points along the curve, with a curvature controlled point
density. That is, the curvier parts will have more points than the straighter
parts.

This approximation makes straight segments between each point, then subdivides
those segments until the resulting shape is similar enough.

`max_stages` controls how many subdivisions a curve segment may face before it
is considered approximate enough. Each subdivision splits the segment in half,
so the default 5 stages may mean up to 32 subdivisions per curve segment.
Increase with care!

`tolerance_degrees` controls how many degrees the midpoint of a segment may
deviate from the real curve, before the segment has to be subdivided.

PackedVector3Array tessellate_even_length(max_stages: int = 5,
tolerance_length: float = 0.2) const

Returns a list of points along the curve, with almost uniform density.
`max_stages` controls how many subdivisions a curve segment may face before it
is considered approximate enough. Each subdivision splits the segment in half,
so the default 5 stages may mean up to 32 subdivisions per curve segment.
Increase with care!

`tolerance_length` controls the maximal distance between two neighboring
points, before the segment has to be subdivided.
