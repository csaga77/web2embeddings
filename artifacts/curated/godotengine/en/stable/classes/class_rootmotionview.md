# RootMotionView

Inherits: VisualInstance3D < Node3D < Node < Object

Editor-only helper for setting up root motion in AnimationMixer.

## Description

Root motion refers to an animation technique where a mesh's skeleton is used
to give impulse to a character. When working with 3D animations, a popular
technique is for animators to use the root skeleton bone to give motion to the
rest of the skeleton. This allows animating characters in a way where steps
actually match the floor below. It also allows precise interaction with
objects during cinematics. See also AnimationMixer.

Note: RootMotionView is only visible in the editor. It will be hidden
automatically in the running project.

## Properties

NodePath | animation_path | `NodePath("")`  
---|---|---  
float | cell_size | `1.0`  
Color | color | `Color(0.5, 0.5, 1, 1)`  
float | radius | `10.0`  
bool | zero_y | `true`  
  
## Property Descriptions

NodePath animation_path = `NodePath("")`

  * void set_animation_path(value: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_animation_path()

Path to an AnimationMixer node to use as a basis for root motion.

float cell_size = `1.0`

  * void set_cell_size(value: float)

  * float get_cell_size()

The grid's cell size in 3D units.

Color color = `Color(0.5, 0.5, 1, 1)`

  * void set_color(value: Color)

  * Color get_color()

The grid's color.

float radius = `10.0`

  * void set_radius(value: float)

  * float get_radius()

The grid's radius in 3D units. The grid's opacity will fade gradually as the
distance from the origin increases until this radius is reached.

bool zero_y = `true`

  * void set_zero_y(value: bool)

  * bool get_zero_y()

If `true`, the grid's points will all be on the same Y coordinate (local Y =
0). If `false`, the points' original Y coordinate is preserved.
