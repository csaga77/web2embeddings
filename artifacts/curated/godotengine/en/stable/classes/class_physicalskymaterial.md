# PhysicalSkyMaterial

Inherits: Material < Resource < RefCounted < Object

A material that defines a sky for a Sky resource by a set of physical
properties.

## Description

The PhysicalSkyMaterial uses the Preetham analytic daylight model to draw a
sky based on physical properties. This results in a substantially more
realistic sky than the ProceduralSkyMaterial, but it is slightly slower and
less flexible.

The PhysicalSkyMaterial only supports one sun. The color, energy, and
direction of the sun are taken from the first DirectionalLight3D in the scene
tree.

## Property Descriptions

float energy_multiplier = `1.0`

  * void set_energy_multiplier(value: float)

  * float get_energy_multiplier()

The sky's overall brightness multiplier. Higher values result in a brighter
sky.

Color ground_color = `Color(0.1, 0.07, 0.034, 1)`

  * void set_ground_color(value: Color)

  * Color get_ground_color()

Modulates the Color on the bottom half of the sky to represent the ground.

float mie_coefficient = `0.005`

  * void set_mie_coefficient(value: float)

  * float get_mie_coefficient()

Controls the strength of Mie scattering for the sky. Mie scattering results
from light colliding with larger particles (like water). On earth, Mie
scattering results in a whitish color around the sun and horizon.

Color mie_color = `Color(0.69, 0.729, 0.812, 1)`

  * void set_mie_color(value: Color)

  * Color get_mie_color()

Controls the Color of the Mie scattering effect. While not physically
accurate, this allows for the creation of alien-looking planets.

float mie_eccentricity = `0.8`

  * void set_mie_eccentricity(value: float)

  * float get_mie_eccentricity()

Controls the direction of the Mie scattering. A value of `1` means that when
light hits a particle it's passing through straight forward. A value of `-1`
means that all light is scatter backwards.

Texture2D night_sky

  * void set_night_sky(value: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_night_sky()

Texture2D for the night sky. This is added to the sky, so if it is bright
enough, it may be visible during the day.

float rayleigh_coefficient = `2.0`

  * void set_rayleigh_coefficient(value: float)

  * float get_rayleigh_coefficient()

Controls the strength of the Rayleigh scattering. Rayleigh scattering results
from light colliding with small particles. It is responsible for the blue
color of the sky.

Color rayleigh_color = `Color(0.3, 0.405, 0.6, 1)`

  * void set_rayleigh_color(value: Color)

  * Color get_rayleigh_color()

Controls the Color of the Rayleigh scattering. While not physically accurate,
this allows for the creation of alien-looking planets. For example, setting
this to a red Color results in a Mars-looking atmosphere with a corresponding
blue sunset.

float sun_disk_scale = `1.0`

  * void set_sun_disk_scale(value: float)

  * float get_sun_disk_scale()

Sets the size of the sun disk. Default value is based on Sol's perceived size
from Earth.

float turbidity = `10.0`

  * void set_turbidity(value: float)

  * float get_turbidity()

Sets the thickness of the atmosphere. High turbidity creates a foggy-looking
atmosphere, while a low turbidity results in a clearer atmosphere.

bool use_debanding = `true`

  * void set_use_debanding(value: bool)

  * bool get_use_debanding()

If `true`, enables debanding. Debanding adds a small amount of noise which
helps reduce banding that appears from the smooth changes in color in the sky.
