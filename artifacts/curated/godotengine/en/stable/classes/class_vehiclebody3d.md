A 3D physics body that simulates the behavior of a car.

## Description

This physics body implements all the physics logic needed to simulate a car.
It is based on the raycast vehicle system commonly found in physics engines.
Aside from a CollisionShape3D for the main body of the vehicle, you must also
add a VehicleWheel3D node for each wheel. You should also add a MeshInstance3D
to this node for the 3D model of the vehicle, but this model should generally
not include meshes for the wheels. You can control the vehicle by using the
brake, engine_force, and steering properties. The position or orientation of
this node shouldn't be changed directly.

Note: The origin point of your VehicleBody3D will determine the center of
gravity of your vehicle. To make the vehicle more grounded, the origin point
is usually kept low, moving the CollisionShape3D and MeshInstance3D upwards.

Note: This class has known issues and isn't designed to provide realistic 3D
vehicle physics. If you want advanced vehicle physics, you may have to write
your own physics integration using CharacterBody3D or RigidBody3D.

## Properties

float | brake | `0.0`

float | engine_force | `0.0`  
float | mass | `40.0` (overrides RigidBody3D)  
float | steering | `0.0`  
  
## Property Descriptions

float brake = `0.0`

  * void set_brake(value: float)

  * float get_brake()

Slows down the vehicle by applying a braking force. The vehicle is only slowed
down if the wheels are in contact with a surface. The force you need to apply
to adequately slow down your vehicle depends on the RigidBody3D.mass of the
vehicle. For a vehicle with a mass set to 1000, try a value in the 25 - 30
range for hard braking.

float engine_force = `0.0`

  * void set_engine_force(value: float)

  * float get_engine_force()

Accelerates the vehicle by applying an engine force. The vehicle is only sped
up if the wheels that have VehicleWheel3D.use_as_traction set to `true` and
are in contact with a surface. The RigidBody3D.mass of the vehicle has an
effect on the acceleration of the vehicle. For a vehicle with a mass set to
1000, try a value in the 25 - 50 range for acceleration.

Note: The simulation does not take the effect of gears into account, you will
need to add logic for this if you wish to simulate gears.

A negative value will result in the vehicle reversing.

float steering = `0.0`

  * void set_steering(value: float)

  * float get_steering()

The steering angle for the vehicle. Setting this to a non-zero value will
result in the vehicle turning when it's moving. Wheels that have
VehicleWheel3D.use_as_steering set to `true` will automatically be rotated.

Note: This property is edited in the inspector in degrees. In code the
property is set in radians.
