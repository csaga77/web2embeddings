# GLTFAccessor

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

Represents a glTF accessor.

## Description

GLTFAccessor is a data structure representing a glTF `accessor` that would be
found in the `"accessors"` array. A buffer is a blob of binary data. A buffer
view is a slice of a buffer. An accessor is a typed interpretation of the data
in a buffer view.

Most custom data stored in glTF does not need accessors, only buffer views
(see GLTFBufferView). Accessors are for more advanced use cases such as
interleaved mesh data encoded for the GPU.

## Enumerations

enum GLTFAccessorType:

GLTFAccessorType TYPE_SCALAR = `0`

a single float, int, or bool value, or a float array.

GLTFAccessorType TYPE_VEC2 = `1`

Accessor type "VEC2". For the glTF object model, this maps to "float2",
represented in the glTF JSON as an array of two floats.

GLTFAccessorType TYPE_VEC3 = `2`

Accessor type "VEC3". For the glTF object model, this maps to "float3",
represented in the glTF JSON as an array of three floats.

GLTFAccessorType TYPE_VEC4 = `3`

Accessor type "VEC4". For the glTF object model, this maps to "float4",
represented in the glTF JSON as an array of four floats.

GLTFAccessorType TYPE_MAT2 = `4`

Accessor type "MAT2". For the glTF object model, this maps to "float2x2",
represented in the glTF JSON as an array of four floats.

GLTFAccessorType TYPE_MAT3 = `5`

Accessor type "MAT3". For the glTF object model, this maps to "float3x3",
represented in the glTF JSON as an array of nine floats.

GLTFAccessorType TYPE_MAT4 = `6`

represented in the glTF JSON as an array of sixteen floats.

enum GLTFComponentType:

GLTFComponentType COMPONENT_TYPE_NONE = `0`

Component type "NONE". This is not a valid component type, and is used to
indicate that the component type is not set.

GLTFComponentType COMPONENT_TYPE_SIGNED_BYTE = `5120`

Component type "BYTE". The value is `0x1400` which comes from OpenGL. This
indicates data is stored in 1-byte or 8-bit signed integers. This is a core
part of the glTF specification.

Component type "UNSIGNED_BYTE". The value is `0x1401` which comes from OpenGL.
This indicates data is stored in 1-byte or 8-bit unsigned integers. This is a
core part of the glTF specification.

GLTFComponentType COMPONENT_TYPE_SIGNED_SHORT = `5122`

Component type "SHORT". The value is `0x1402` which comes from OpenGL. This
indicates data is stored in 2-byte or 16-bit signed integers. This is a core
part of the glTF specification.

GLTFComponentType COMPONENT_TYPE_UNSIGNED_SHORT = `5123`

Component type "UNSIGNED_SHORT". The value is `0x1403` which comes from
OpenGL. This indicates data is stored in 2-byte or 16-bit unsigned integers.
This is a core part of the glTF specification.

GLTFComponentType COMPONENT_TYPE_SIGNED_INT = `5124`

Component type "INT". The value is `0x1404` which comes from OpenGL. This
indicates data is stored in 4-byte or 32-bit signed integers. This is NOT a
core part of the glTF specification, and may not be supported by all glTF
importers. May be used by some extensions including `KHR_interactivity`.

GLTFComponentType COMPONENT_TYPE_UNSIGNED_INT = `5125`

Component type "UNSIGNED_INT". The value is `0x1405` which comes from OpenGL.
This indicates data is stored in 4-byte or 32-bit unsigned integers. This is a
core part of the glTF specification.

GLTFComponentType COMPONENT_TYPE_SINGLE_FLOAT = `5126`

Component type "FLOAT". The value is `0x1406` which comes from OpenGL. This
indicates data is stored in 4-byte or 32-bit floating-point numbers. This is a
core part of the glTF specification.

GLTFComponentType COMPONENT_TYPE_DOUBLE_FLOAT = `5130`

Component type "DOUBLE". The value is `0x140A` which comes from OpenGL. This
indicates data is stored in 8-byte or 64-bit floating-point numbers. This is
NOT a core part of the glTF specification, and may not be supported by all
glTF importers. May be used by some extensions including `KHR_interactivity`.

GLTFComponentType COMPONENT_TYPE_HALF_FLOAT = `5131`

Component type "HALF_FLOAT". The value is `0x140B` which comes from OpenGL.

is NOT a core part of the glTF specification, and may not be supported by all
