A sphere-shaped 3D particle collision shape affecting GPUParticles3D nodes.

## Description

A sphere-shaped 3D particle collision shape affecting GPUParticles3D nodes.

Particle collision shapes work in real-time and can be moved, rotated and
scaled during gameplay. Unlike attractors, non-uniform scaling of collision
shapes is not supported.

Note: ParticleProcessMaterial.collision_mode must be
ParticleProcessMaterial.COLLISION_RIGID or
ParticleProcessMaterial.COLLISION_HIDE_ON_CONTACT on the GPUParticles3D's
process material for collision to work.

Note: Particle collision only affects GPUParticles3D, not CPUParticles3D.

## Properties
