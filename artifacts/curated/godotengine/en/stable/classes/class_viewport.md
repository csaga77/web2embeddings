# Viewport

Inherits: Node < Object

Inherited By: SubViewport, Window

Abstract base class for viewports. Encapsulates drawing and interaction with a
game world.

## Description

A Viewport creates a different view into the screen, or a sub-view inside
another viewport. Child 2D nodes will display on it, and child Camera3D 3D
nodes will render on it too.

Optionally, a viewport can have its own 2D or 3D world, so it doesn't share
what it draws with other viewports.

Viewports can also choose to be audio listeners, so they generate positional
audio depending on a 2D or 3D camera child of it.

Also, viewports can be assigned to different screens in case the devices have
multiple screens.

Finally, viewports can also behave as render targets, in which case they will
not be visible unless the associated texture is used to draw.

be set using scaling_3d_scale. Values less than `1.0` will result in
undersampling while values greater than `1.0` will result in supersampling. A
value of `1.0` disables scaling.

Scaling3DMode SCALING_3D_MODE_FSR = `1`

Use AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0 upscaling for the viewport's 3D
buffer. The amount of scaling can be set using scaling_3d_scale. Values less
than `1.0` will be result in the viewport being upscaled using FSR. Values
greater than `1.0` are not supported and bilinear downsampling will be used
instead. A value of `1.0` disables scaling.

Scaling3DMode SCALING_3D_MODE_FSR2 = `2`

Use AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.2 upscaling for the viewport's 3D
buffer. The amount of scaling can be set using scaling_3d_scale. Values less
than `1.0` will be result in the viewport being upscaled using FSR2. Values
greater than `1.0` are not supported and bilinear downsampling will be used
instead. A value of `1.0` will use FSR2 at native resolution as a TAA
solution.

Scaling3DMode SCALING_3D_MODE_METALFX_SPATIAL = `3`

Use the MetalFX spatial upscaler for the viewport's 3D buffer.

The amount of scaling can be set using scaling_3d_scale.

Values less than `1.0` will be result in the viewport being upscaled using
MetalFX. Values greater than `1.0` are not supported and bilinear downsampling
will be used instead. A value of `1.0` disables scaling.

More information: MetalFX.

Note: Only supported when the Metal rendering driver is in use, which limits
this scaling mode to macOS and iOS.

Scaling3DMode SCALING_3D_MODE_METALFX_TEMPORAL = `4`

Use the MetalFX temporal upscaler for the viewport's 3D buffer.

The amount of scaling can be set using scaling_3d_scale. To determine the
minimum input scale, use the RenderingDevice.limit_get() method with
RenderingDevice.LIMIT_METALFX_TEMPORAL_SCALER_MIN_SCALE.

Values less than `1.0` will be result in the viewport being upscaled using
MetalFX. Values greater than `1.0` are not supported and bilinear downsampling
will be used instead. A value of `1.0` will use MetalFX at native resolution
as a TAA solution.

More information: MetalFX.

Note: Only supported when the Metal rendering driver is in use, which limits
this scaling mode to macOS and iOS.

Scaling3DMode SCALING_3D_MODE_MAX = `5`

Represents the size of the Scaling3DMode enum.

enum MSAA:

MSAA MSAA_DISABLED = `0`

Multisample antialiasing mode disabled. This is the default value, and is also
the fastest setting.

MSAA MSAA_2X = `1`

Use 2 Multisample Antialiasing. This has a moderate performance cost. It helps
reduce aliasing noticeably, but 4 MSAA still looks substantially better.

MSAA MSAA_4X = `2`

Use 4 Multisample Antialiasing. This has a significant performance cost, and
is generally a good compromise between performance and quality.

MSAA MSAA_8X = `3`

Use 8 Multisample Antialiasing. This has a very high performance cost. The
difference between 4 and 8 MSAA may not always be visible in real gameplay
conditions. Likely unsupported on low-end and older hardware.

MSAA MSAA_MAX = `4`

Represents the size of the MSAA enum.

enum AnisotropicFiltering:

AnisotropicFiltering ANISOTROPY_DISABLED = `0`

ScreenSpaceAA SCREEN_SPACE_AA_DISABLED = `0`

Do not perform any antialiasing in the full screen post-process.

ScreenSpaceAA SCREEN_SPACE_AA_FXAA = `1`

Use fast approximate antialiasing. FXAA is a popular screen-space antialiasing
method, which is fast but will make the image look blurry, especially at lower
resolutions. It can still work relatively well at large resolutions such as
1440p and 4K.

ScreenSpaceAA SCREEN_SPACE_AA_MAX = `2`

Represents the size of the ScreenSpaceAA enum.

are wasting performance on drawing pixels that are being hidden behind others.

DebugDraw DEBUG_DRAW_WIREFRAME = `4`

Objects are displayed as wireframe models.

Note: RenderingServer.set_debug_generate_wireframes() must be called before
loading any meshes for wireframes to be visible when using the Compatibility
renderer.

Draws the scene luminance buffer (if available) in the upper left quadrant of
the Viewport.

DebugDraw DEBUG_DRAW_SSAO = `12`

Draws the screen-space ambient occlusion texture instead of the scene so that
you can clearly see how it is affecting objects. In order for this display
mode to work, you must have Environment.ssao_enabled set in your
WorldEnvironment.

DebugDraw DEBUG_DRAW_SSIL = `13`

Draws the screen-space indirect lighting texture instead of the scene so that
you can clearly see how it is affecting objects. In order for this display
mode to work, you must have Environment.ssil_enabled set in your
WorldEnvironment.

DebugDraw DEBUG_DRAW_PSSM_SPLITS = `14`

Colors each PSSM split for the DirectionalLight3Ds in the scene a different
color so you can see where the splits are. In order, they will be colored red,
green, blue, and yellow.

Draws the decal atlas used by Decals and light projector textures in the upper
left quadrant of the Viewport.

DebugDraw DEBUG_DRAW_SDFGI = `16`

between frames.

DebugDraw DEBUG_DRAW_INTERNAL_BUFFER = `26`

Draws the internal resolution buffer of the scene before post-processing is
applied.

enum DefaultCanvasItemTextureFilter:

DefaultCanvasItemTextureFilter DEFAULT_CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST =
`0`

The texture filter reads from the nearest pixel only. This makes the texture
look pixelated from up close, and grainy from a distance (due to mipmaps not
being sampled).

DefaultCanvasItemTextureFilter DEFAULT_CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR = `1`

The texture filter blends between the nearest 4 pixels. This makes the texture
look smooth from up close, and grainy from a distance (due to mipmaps not
being sampled).

DefaultCanvasItemTextureFilter
DEFAULT_CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_WITH_MIPMAPS = `2`

The texture filter blends between the nearest 4 pixels and between the nearest
2 mipmaps (or uses the nearest mipmap if
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/default_filters/use_nearest_mipmap_filter
is `true`). This makes the texture look smooth from up close, and smooth from
a distance.

Use this for non-pixel art textures that may be viewed at a low scale (e.g.
due to Camera2D zoom or sprite scaling), as mipmaps are important to smooth
out pixels that are smaller than on-screen pixels.

DefaultCanvasItemTextureFilter
DEFAULT_CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST_WITH_MIPMAPS = `3`

The texture filter reads from the nearest pixel and blends between the nearest
2 mipmaps (or uses the nearest mipmap if
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/default_filters/use_nearest_mipmap_filter
is `true`). This makes the texture look pixelated from up close, and smooth
from a distance.

Use this for non-pixel art textures that may be viewed at a low scale (e.g.
due to Camera2D zoom or sprite scaling), as mipmaps are important to smooth
out pixels that are smaller than on-screen pixels.

DefaultCanvasItemTextureFilter DEFAULT_CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_FILTER_MAX = `4`

Represents the size of the DefaultCanvasItemTextureFilter enum.

enum DefaultCanvasItemTextureRepeat:

DefaultCanvasItemTextureRepeat DEFAULT_CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_REPEAT_DISABLED =
`0`

Disables textures repeating. Instead, when reading UVs outside the 0-1 range,
the value will be clamped to the edge of the texture, resulting in a stretched
out look at the borders of the texture.

DefaultCanvasItemTextureRepeat DEFAULT_CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_REPEAT_ENABLED =
`1`

Enables the texture to repeat when UV coordinates are outside the 0-1 range.
If using one of the linear filtering modes, this can result in artifacts at
the edges of a texture when the sampler filters across the edges of the
texture.

DefaultCanvasItemTextureRepeat DEFAULT_CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_REPEAT_MIRROR = `2`

Flip the texture when repeating so that the edge lines up instead of abruptly
changing.

DefaultCanvasItemTextureRepeat DEFAULT_CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_REPEAT_MAX = `3`

Represents the size of the DefaultCanvasItemTextureRepeat enum.

enum SDFOversize:

SDFOversize SDF_OVERSIZE_100_PERCENT = `0`

The signed distance field only covers the viewport's own rectangle.

SDFOversize SDF_OVERSIZE_120_PERCENT = `1`

The signed distance field is expanded to cover 20% of the viewport's size
around the borders.

around the borders.

SDFOversize SDF_OVERSIZE_200_PERCENT = `3`

The signed distance field is expanded to cover 100% (double) of the viewport's
size around the borders.

## Property Descriptions

AnisotropicFiltering anisotropic_filtering_level = `2`

  * void set_anisotropic_filtering_level(value: AnisotropicFiltering)

  * AnisotropicFiltering get_anisotropic_filtering_level()

Sets the maximum number of samples to take when using anisotropic filtering on
textures (as a power of two). A higher sample count will result in sharper
textures at oblique angles, but is more expensive to compute. A value of `0`
forcibly disables anisotropic filtering, even on materials where it is
enabled.

The anisotropic filtering level also affects decals and light projectors if
they are configured to use anisotropic filtering. See
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/decals/filter and
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/light_projectors/filter.

Note: In 3D, for this setting to have an effect, set
BaseMaterial3D.texture_filter to
BaseMaterial3D.TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC or
BaseMaterial3D.TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC on materials.

Note: In 2D, for this setting to have an effect, set CanvasItem.texture_filter
to CanvasItem.TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC or
CanvasItem.TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC on the CanvasItem
node displaying the texture (or in CanvasTexture). However, anisotropic
filtering is rarely useful in 2D, so only enable it for textures in 2D if it
makes a meaningful visual difference.

bool audio_listener_enable_2d = `false`

  * void set_as_audio_listener_2d(value: bool)

  * bool is_audio_listener_2d()

If `true`, the viewport will process 2D audio streams.

bool audio_listener_enable_3d = `false`

  * void set_as_audio_listener_3d(value: bool)

  * bool is_audio_listener_3d()

If `true`, the viewport will process 3D audio streams.

int canvas_cull_mask = `4294967295`

  * void set_canvas_cull_mask(value: int)

  * int get_canvas_cull_mask()

The rendering layers in which this Viewport renders CanvasItem nodes.

DefaultCanvasItemTextureFilter canvas_item_default_texture_filter = `1`

  * void set_default_canvas_item_texture_filter(value: DefaultCanvasItemTextureFilter)

  * DefaultCanvasItemTextureFilter get_default_canvas_item_texture_filter()

Sets the default filter mode used by CanvasItems in this Viewport. See
DefaultCanvasItemTextureFilter for options.

DefaultCanvasItemTextureRepeat canvas_item_default_texture_repeat = `0`

  * void set_default_canvas_item_texture_repeat(value: DefaultCanvasItemTextureRepeat)

  * DefaultCanvasItemTextureRepeat get_default_canvas_item_texture_repeat()

Sets the default repeat mode used by CanvasItems in this Viewport. See
DefaultCanvasItemTextureRepeat for options.

Transform2D canvas_transform

  * void set_canvas_transform(value: Transform2D)

  * Transform2D get_canvas_transform()

The canvas transform of the viewport, useful for changing the on-screen
positions of all child CanvasItems. This is relative to the global canvas
transform of the viewport.

DebugDraw debug_draw = `0`

  * void set_debug_draw(value: DebugDraw)

  * DebugDraw get_debug_draw()

The overlay mode for test rendered geometry in debug purposes.

bool disable_3d = `false`

  * void set_disable_3d(value: bool)

  * bool is_3d_disabled()

Disable 3D rendering (but keep 2D rendering).

float fsr_sharpness = `0.2`

  * void set_fsr_sharpness(value: float)

  * float get_fsr_sharpness()

Determines how sharp the upscaled image will be when using the FSR upscaling
mode. Sharpness halves with every whole number. Values go from 0.0 (sharpest)
to 2.0. Values above 2.0 won't make a visible difference.

To control this property on the root viewport, set the
ProjectSettings.rendering/scaling_3d/fsr_sharpness project setting.

Transform2D global_canvas_transform

  * void set_global_canvas_transform(value: Transform2D)

  * Transform2D get_global_canvas_transform()

The global canvas transform of the viewport. The canvas transform is relative
to this.

bool gui_disable_input = `false`

  * void set_disable_input(value: bool)

  * bool is_input_disabled()

If `true`, the viewport will not receive input events.

bool gui_embed_subwindows = `false`

  * void set_embedding_subwindows(value: bool)

  * bool is_embedding_subwindows()

If `true`, sub-windows (popups and dialogs) will be embedded inside
application window as control-like nodes. If `false`, they will appear as
separate windows handled by the operating system.

bool gui_snap_controls_to_pixels = `true`

  * void set_snap_controls_to_pixels(value: bool)

  * bool is_snap_controls_to_pixels_enabled()

If `true`, the GUI controls on the viewport will lay pixel perfectly.

bool handle_input_locally = `true`

  * void set_handle_input_locally(value: bool)

  * bool is_handling_input_locally()

If `true`, this viewport will mark incoming input events as handled by itself.
If `false`, this is instead done by the first parent viewport that is set to
handle input locally.

A SubViewportContainer will automatically set this property to `false` for the
Viewport contained inside of it.

See also set_input_as_handled() and is_input_handled().

float mesh_lod_threshold = `1.0`

  * void set_mesh_lod_threshold(value: float)

  * float get_mesh_lod_threshold()

The automatic LOD bias to use for meshes rendered within the Viewport (this is
analogous to ReflectionProbe.mesh_lod_threshold). Higher values will use less
detailed versions of meshes that have LOD variations generated. If set to
`0.0`, automatic LOD is disabled. Increase mesh_lod_threshold to improve
performance at the cost of geometry detail.

To control this property on the root viewport, set the
ProjectSettings.rendering/mesh_lod/lod_change/threshold_pixels project
setting.

Note: mesh_lod_threshold does not affect GeometryInstance3D visibility ranges
(also known as "manual" LOD or hierarchical LOD).

MSAA msaa_2d = `0`

  * void set_msaa_2d(value: MSAA)

  * MSAA get_msaa_2d()

The multisample antialiasing mode for 2D/Canvas rendering. A higher number
results in smoother edges at the cost of significantly worse performance. A
value of MSAA_2X or MSAA_4X is best unless targeting very high-end systems.
This has no effect on shader-induced aliasing or texture aliasing.

See also ProjectSettings.rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/msaa_2d and
RenderingServer.viewport_set_msaa_2d().

MSAA msaa_3d = `0`

  * void set_msaa_3d(value: MSAA)

  * MSAA get_msaa_3d()

The multisample antialiasing mode for 3D rendering. A higher number results in
smoother edges at the cost of significantly worse performance. A value of
MSAA_2X or MSAA_4X is best unless targeting very high-end systems. See also
bilinear scaling 3D scaling_3d_mode for supersampling, which provides higher
quality but is much more expensive. This has no effect on shader-induced
aliasing or texture aliasing.

See also ProjectSettings.rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/msaa_3d and
RenderingServer.viewport_set_msaa_3d().

bool own_world_3d = `false`

  * void set_use_own_world_3d(value: bool)

  * bool is_using_own_world_3d()

If `true`, the viewport will use a unique copy of the World3D defined in
world_3d.

bool physics_object_picking = `false`

  * void set_physics_object_picking(value: bool)

  * bool get_physics_object_picking()

If `true`, the objects rendered by viewport become subjects of mouse picking
process.

Note: The number of simultaneously pickable objects is limited to 64 and they
are selected in a non-deterministic order, which can be different in each
picking process.

bool physics_object_picking_first_only = `false`

  * void set_physics_object_picking_first_only(value: bool)

  * bool get_physics_object_picking_first_only()

If `true`, the input_event signal will only be sent to one physics object in
the mouse picking process. If you want to get the top object only, you must
also enable physics_object_picking_sort.

If `false`, an input_event signal will be sent to all physics objects in the
mouse picking process.

This applies to 2D CanvasItem object picking only.

bool physics_object_picking_sort = `false`

  * void set_physics_object_picking_sort(value: bool)

  * bool get_physics_object_picking_sort()

If `true`, objects receive mouse picking events sorted primarily by their
CanvasItem.z_index and secondarily by their position in the scene tree. If
`false`, the order is undetermined.

Note: This setting is disabled by default because of its potential expensive
computational cost.

Note: Sorting happens after selecting the pickable objects. Because of the
limitation of 64 simultaneously pickable objects, it is not guaranteed that
the object with the highest CanvasItem.z_index receives the picking event.

bool positional_shadow_atlas_16_bits = `true`

  * void set_positional_shadow_atlas_16_bits(value: bool)

  * bool get_positional_shadow_atlas_16_bits()

Use 16 bits for the omni/spot shadow depth map. Enabling this results in
shadows having less precision and may result in shadow acne, but can lead to
performance improvements on some devices.

PositionalShadowAtlasQuadrantSubdiv positional_shadow_atlas_quad_0 = `2`

  * void set_positional_shadow_atlas_quadrant_subdiv(quadrant: int, subdiv: PositionalShadowAtlasQuadrantSubdiv)

  * PositionalShadowAtlasQuadrantSubdiv get_positional_shadow_atlas_quadrant_subdiv(quadrant: int) const

The subdivision amount of the first quadrant on the shadow atlas.

PositionalShadowAtlasQuadrantSubdiv positional_shadow_atlas_quad_1 = `2`

  * void set_positional_shadow_atlas_quadrant_subdiv(quadrant: int, subdiv: PositionalShadowAtlasQuadrantSubdiv)

  * PositionalShadowAtlasQuadrantSubdiv get_positional_shadow_atlas_quadrant_subdiv(quadrant: int) const

The subdivision amount of the second quadrant on the shadow atlas.

PositionalShadowAtlasQuadrantSubdiv positional_shadow_atlas_quad_2 = `3`

  * void set_positional_shadow_atlas_quadrant_subdiv(quadrant: int, subdiv: PositionalShadowAtlasQuadrantSubdiv)

  * PositionalShadowAtlasQuadrantSubdiv get_positional_shadow_atlas_quadrant_subdiv(quadrant: int) const

The subdivision amount of the third quadrant on the shadow atlas.

PositionalShadowAtlasQuadrantSubdiv positional_shadow_atlas_quad_3 = `4`

  * void set_positional_shadow_atlas_quadrant_subdiv(quadrant: int, subdiv: PositionalShadowAtlasQuadrantSubdiv)

  * PositionalShadowAtlasQuadrantSubdiv get_positional_shadow_atlas_quadrant_subdiv(quadrant: int) const

The subdivision amount of the fourth quadrant on the shadow atlas.

int positional_shadow_atlas_size = `2048`

  * void set_positional_shadow_atlas_size(value: int)

  * int get_positional_shadow_atlas_size()

The shadow atlas' resolution (used for omni and spot lights). The value is
rounded up to the nearest power of 2.

Note: If this is set to `0`, no positional shadows will be visible at all.
This can improve performance significantly on low-end systems by reducing both
the CPU and GPU load (as fewer draw calls are needed to draw the scene without
shadows).

Scaling3DMode scaling_3d_mode = `0`

  * void set_scaling_3d_mode(value: Scaling3DMode)

  * Scaling3DMode get_scaling_3d_mode()

Sets scaling 3D mode. Bilinear scaling renders at different resolution to
either undersample or supersample the viewport. FidelityFX Super Resolution
1.0, abbreviated to FSR, is an upscaling technology that produces high quality
images at fast framerates by using a spatially aware upscaling algorithm. FSR
is slightly more expensive than bilinear, but it produces significantly higher
image quality. FSR should be used where possible.

To control this property on the root viewport, set the
ProjectSettings.rendering/scaling_3d/mode project setting.

float scaling_3d_scale = `1.0`

  * void set_scaling_3d_scale(value: float)

  * float get_scaling_3d_scale()

Scales the 3D render buffer based on the viewport size uses an image filter
specified in ProjectSettings.rendering/scaling_3d/mode to scale the output
image to the full viewport size. Values lower than `1.0` can be used to speed
up 3D rendering at the cost of quality (undersampling). Values greater than
`1.0` are only valid for bilinear mode and can be used to improve 3D rendering
quality at a high performance cost (supersampling). See also
ProjectSettings.rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/msaa_3d for multi-sample
antialiasing, which is significantly cheaper but only smooths the edges of
polygons.

When using FSR upscaling, AMD recommends exposing the following values as
preset options to users "Ultra Quality: 0.77", "Quality: 0.67", "Balanced:
0.59", "Performance: 0.5" instead of exposing the entire scale.

To control this property on the root viewport, set the
ProjectSettings.rendering/scaling_3d/scale project setting.

ScreenSpaceAA screen_space_aa = `0`

  * void set_screen_space_aa(value: ScreenSpaceAA)

  * ScreenSpaceAA get_screen_space_aa()

Sets the screen-space antialiasing method used. Screen-space antialiasing
works by selectively blurring edges in a post-process shader. It differs from
MSAA which takes multiple coverage samples while rendering objects. Screen-
space AA methods are typically faster than MSAA and will smooth out specular
aliasing, but tend to make scenes appear blurry.

See also ProjectSettings.rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/screen_space_aa and
RenderingServer.viewport_set_screen_space_aa().

SDFOversize sdf_oversize = `1`

  * void set_sdf_oversize(value: SDFOversize)

  * SDFOversize get_sdf_oversize()

Controls how much of the original viewport's size should be covered by the 2D
signed distance field. This SDF can be sampled in CanvasItem shaders and is
also used for GPUParticles2D collision. Higher values allow portions of
occluders located outside the viewport to still be taken into account in the
generated signed distance field, at the cost of performance. If you notice
particles falling through LightOccluder2Ds as the occluders leave the
viewport, increase this setting.

The percentage is added on each axis and on both sides. For example, with the
default SDF_OVERSIZE_120_PERCENT, the signed distance field will cover 20% of
the viewport's size outside the viewport on each side (top, right, bottom,
left).

SDFScale sdf_scale = `1`

  * void set_sdf_scale(value: SDFScale)

  * SDFScale get_sdf_scale()

The resolution scale to use for the 2D signed distance field. Higher values
lead to a more precise and more stable signed distance field as the camera
moves, at the cost of performance.

bool snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel = `false`

  * void set_snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel(value: bool)

  * bool is_snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel_enabled()

If `true`, CanvasItem nodes will internally snap to full pixels. Their
position can still be sub-pixel, but the decimals will not have effect. This
can lead to a crisper appearance at the cost of less smooth movement,
especially when Camera2D smoothing is enabled.

bool snap_2d_vertices_to_pixel = `false`

  * void set_snap_2d_vertices_to_pixel(value: bool)

  * bool is_snap_2d_vertices_to_pixel_enabled()

If `true`, vertices of CanvasItem nodes will snap to full pixels. Only affects
the final vertex positions, not the transforms. This can lead to a crisper
appearance at the cost of less smooth movement, especially when Camera2D
smoothing is enabled.

float texture_mipmap_bias = `0.0`

  * void set_texture_mipmap_bias(value: float)

  * float get_texture_mipmap_bias()

Affects the final texture sharpness by reading from a lower or higher mipmap
(also called "texture LOD bias"). Negative values make mipmapped textures
sharper but grainier when viewed at a distance, while positive values make
mipmapped textures blurrier (even when up close).

Enabling temporal antialiasing (use_taa) will automatically apply a `-0.5`
offset to this value, while enabling FXAA (screen_space_aa) will automatically
apply a `-0.25` offset to this value. If both TAA and FXAA are enabled at the
same time, an offset of `-0.75` is applied to this value.

Note: If scaling_3d_scale is lower than `1.0` (exclusive), texture_mipmap_bias
is used to adjust the automatic mipmap bias which is calculated internally
based on the scale factor. The formula for this is `log2(scaling_3d_scale) +
mipmap_bias`.

To control this property on the root viewport, set the
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/default_filters/texture_mipmap_bias project
setting.

bool transparent_bg = `false`

  * void set_transparent_background(value: bool)

  * bool has_transparent_background()

If `true`, the viewport should render its background as transparent.

bool use_debanding = `false`

  * void set_use_debanding(value: bool)

  * bool is_using_debanding()

If `true`, uses a fast post-processing filter to make banding significantly
less visible in 3D. 2D rendering is not affected by debanding unless the
Environment.background_mode is Environment.BG_CANVAS.

In some cases, debanding may introduce a slightly noticeable dithering
pattern. It's recommended to enable debanding only when actually needed since
the dithering pattern will make lossless-compressed screenshots larger.

See also ProjectSettings.rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/use_debanding and
RenderingServer.viewport_set_use_debanding().

bool use_hdr_2d = `false`

  * void set_use_hdr_2d(value: bool)

  * bool is_using_hdr_2d()

If `true`, 2D rendering will use an high dynamic range (HDR) format
framebuffer matching the bit depth of the 3D framebuffer. When using the
Forward+ renderer this will be an `RGBA16` framebuffer, while when using the
Mobile renderer it will be an `RGB10_A2` framebuffer. Additionally, 2D
rendering will take place in linear color space and will be converted to sRGB
space immediately before blitting to the screen (if the Viewport is attached
to the screen). Practically speaking, this means that the end result of the
Viewport will not be clamped into the `0-1` range and can be used in 3D
rendering without color space adjustments. This allows 2D rendering to take
advantage of effects requiring high dynamic range (e.g. 2D glow) as well as
substantially improves the appearance of effects requiring highly detailed
gradients.

Note: This setting will have no effect when using the Compatibility renderer,
which always renders in low dynamic range for performance reasons.

bool use_occlusion_culling = `false`

  * void set_use_occlusion_culling(value: bool)

  * bool is_using_occlusion_culling()

If `true`, OccluderInstance3D nodes will be usable for occlusion culling in 3D
for this viewport. For the root viewport,
ProjectSettings.rendering/occlusion_culling/use_occlusion_culling must be set
to `true` instead.

Note: Enabling occlusion culling has a cost on the CPU. Only enable occlusion
culling if you actually plan to use it, and think whether your scene can
actually benefit from occlusion culling. Large, open scenes with few or no
objects blocking the view will generally not benefit much from occlusion
culling. Large open scenes generally benefit more from mesh LOD and visibility
ranges (GeometryInstance3D.visibility_range_begin and
GeometryInstance3D.visibility_range_end) compared to occlusion culling.

Note: Due to memory constraints, occlusion culling is not supported by default
in Web export templates. It can be enabled by compiling custom Web export
templates with `module_raycast_enabled=yes`.

bool use_taa = `false`

  * void set_use_taa(value: bool)

  * bool is_using_taa()

Enables temporal antialiasing for this viewport. TAA works by jittering the
camera and accumulating the images of the last rendered frames, motion vector
rendering is used to account for camera and object motion.

Note: The implementation is not complete yet, some visual instances such as
particles and skinned meshes may show artifacts.

See also ProjectSettings.rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/use_taa and
RenderingServer.viewport_set_use_taa().

bool use_xr = `false`

  * void set_use_xr(value: bool)

  * bool is_using_xr()

If `true`, the viewport will use the primary XR interface to render XR output.
When applicable this can result in a stereoscopic image and the resulting
render being output to a headset.

VRSMode vrs_mode = `0`

  * void set_vrs_mode(value: VRSMode)

  * VRSMode get_vrs_mode()

The Variable Rate Shading (VRS) mode that is used for this viewport. Note, if
hardware does not support VRS this property is ignored.

Texture2D vrs_texture

  * void set_vrs_texture(value: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_vrs_texture()

Texture to use when vrs_mode is set to VRS_TEXTURE.

The texture must use a lossless compression format so that colors can be
matched precisely. The following VRS densities are mapped to various colors,
with brighter colors representing a lower level of shading precision:

    
    
    - 11 = rgb(0, 0, 0)     - #000000
    - 12 = rgb(0, 85, 0)    - #005500
    - 21 = rgb(85, 0, 0)    - #550000
    - 22 = rgb(85, 85, 0)   - #555500
    - 24 = rgb(85, 170, 0)  - #55aa00
    - 42 = rgb(170, 85, 0)  - #aa5500
    - 44 = rgb(170, 170, 0) - #aaaa00
    - 48 = rgb(170, 255, 0) - #aaff00 - Not supported on most hardware
    - 84 = rgb(255, 170, 0) - #ffaa00 - Not supported on most hardware
    - 88 = rgb(255, 255, 0) - #ffff00 - Not supported on most hardware
    

VRSUpdateMode vrs_update_mode = `1`

  * void set_vrs_update_mode(value: VRSUpdateMode)

  * VRSUpdateMode get_vrs_update_mode()

Sets the update mode for Variable Rate Shading (VRS) for the viewport. VRS
requires the input texture to be converted to the format usable by the VRS
method supported by the hardware. The update mode defines how often this
happens. If the GPU does not support VRS, or VRS is not enabled, this property
is ignored.

World2D world_2d

  * void set_world_2d(value: World2D)

  * World2D get_world_2d()

The custom World2D which can be used as 2D environment source.

World3D world_3d

  * void set_world_3d(value: World3D)

  * World3D get_world_3d()

The custom World3D which can be used as 3D environment source.

## Method Descriptions

World2D find_world_2d() const

Returns the first valid World2D for this viewport, searching the world_2d
property of itself and any Viewport ancestor.

World3D find_world_3d() const

Returns the first valid World3D for this viewport, searching the world_3d
property of itself and any Viewport ancestor.

AudioListener2D get_audio_listener_2d() const

Returns the currently active 2D audio listener. Returns `null` if there are no
active 2D audio listeners, in which case the active 2D camera will be treated
as listener.

AudioListener3D get_audio_listener_3d() const

Returns the currently active 3D audio listener. Returns `null` if there are no
active 3D audio listeners, in which case the active 3D camera will be treated
as listener.

Camera2D get_camera_2d() const

Returns the currently active 2D camera. Returns `null` if there are no active
cameras.

Camera3D get_camera_3d() const

Returns the currently active 3D camera.

bool get_canvas_cull_mask_bit(layer: int) const

Returns an individual bit on the rendering layer mask.

Array[Window] get_embedded_subwindows() const

Returns a list of the visible embedded Windows inside the viewport.

Note: Windows inside other viewports will not be listed.

Transform2D get_final_transform() const

Returns the transform from the viewport's coordinate system to the embedder's
coordinate system.

Vector2 get_mouse_position() const

Returns the mouse's position in this Viewport using the coordinate system of
this Viewport.

PositionalShadowAtlasQuadrantSubdiv
get_positional_shadow_atlas_quadrant_subdiv(quadrant: int) const

Returns the positional shadow atlas quadrant subdivision of the specified
quadrant.

int get_render_info(type: RenderInfoType, info: RenderInfo)

Returns rendering statistics of the given type. See RenderInfoType and
RenderInfo for options.

Transform2D get_screen_transform() const

Returns the transform from the Viewport's coordinates to the screen
coordinates of the containing window manager window.

Transform2D get_stretch_transform() const

Returns the automatically computed 2D stretch transform, taking the Viewport's
stretch settings into account. The final value is multiplied by
Window.content_scale_factor, but only for the root viewport. If this method is
called on a SubViewport (e.g., in a scene tree with SubViewportContainer and
SubViewport), the scale factor of the root window will not be applied. Using
Transform2D.get_scale() on the returned value, this can be used to compensate
for scaling when zooming a Camera2D node, or to scale down a TextureRect to be
pixel-perfect regardless of the automatically computed scale factor.

Note: Due to how pixel scaling works, the returned transform's X and Y scale
may differ slightly, even when Window.content_scale_aspect is set to a mode
that preserves the pixels' aspect ratio. If Window.content_scale_aspect is
Window.CONTENT_SCALE_ASPECT_IGNORE, the X and Y scale may differ
significantly.

ViewportTexture get_texture() const

Returns the viewport's texture.

Note: When trying to store the current texture (e.g. in a file), it might be
completely black or outdated if used too early, especially when used in e.g.
Node._ready(). To make sure the texture you get is correct, you can await
RenderingServer.frame_post_draw signal.

    
    
    func _ready():
        await RenderingServer.frame_post_draw
        $Viewport.get_texture().get_image().save_png("user://Screenshot.png")
    

Note: When use_hdr_2d is `true` the returned texture will be an HDR image
encoded in linear space.

RID get_viewport_rid() const

Returns the viewport's RID from the RenderingServer.

Rect2 get_visible_rect() const

Returns the visible rectangle in global screen coordinates.

void gui_cancel_drag()

Cancels the drag operation that was previously started through
Control._get_drag_data() or forced with Control.force_drag().

Variant gui_get_drag_data() const

Returns the drag data from the GUI, that was previously returned by
Control._get_drag_data().

Control gui_get_focus_owner() const

Returns the currently focused Control within this viewport. If no Control is
focused, returns `null`.

Control gui_get_hovered_control() const

Returns the Control that the mouse is currently hovering over in this
viewport. If no Control has the cursor, returns `null`.

Typically the leaf Control node or deepest level of the subtree which claims
hover. This is very useful when used together with Node.is_ancestor_of() to
find if the mouse is within a control tree.

bool gui_is_drag_successful() const

Returns `true` if the drag operation is successful.

bool gui_is_dragging() const

Returns `true` if a drag operation is currently ongoing and where the drop
action could happen in this viewport.

Alternative to Node.NOTIFICATION_DRAG_BEGIN and Node.NOTIFICATION_DRAG_END
when you prefer polling the value.

void gui_release_focus()

Removes the focus from the currently focused Control within this viewport. If
no Control has the focus, does nothing.

bool is_input_handled() const

Returns whether the current InputEvent has been handled. Input events are not
handled until set_input_as_handled() has been called during the lifetime of an
InputEvent.

This is usually done as part of input handling methods like Node._input(),
Control._gui_input() or others, as well as in corresponding signal handlers.

If handle_input_locally is set to `false`, this method will try finding the
first parent viewport that is set to handle input locally, and return its
value for is_input_handled() instead.

void notify_mouse_entered()

Inform the Viewport that the mouse has entered its area. Use this function
before sending an InputEventMouseButton or InputEventMouseMotion to the
Viewport with push_input(). See also notify_mouse_exited().

Note: In most cases, it is not necessary to call this function because
SubViewport nodes that are children of SubViewportContainer are notified
automatically. This is only necessary when interacting with viewports in non-
default ways, for example as textures in TextureRect or with an Area3D that
forwards input events.

void notify_mouse_exited()

Inform the Viewport that the mouse has left its area. Use this function when
the node that displays the viewport notices the mouse has left the area of the
displayed viewport. See also notify_mouse_entered().

Note: In most cases, it is not necessary to call this function because
SubViewport nodes that are children of SubViewportContainer are notified
automatically. This is only necessary when interacting with viewports in non-
default ways, for example as textures in TextureRect or with an Area3D that
forwards input events.

void push_input(event: InputEvent, in_local_coords: bool = false)

Triggers the given `event` in this Viewport. This can be used to pass an
InputEvent between viewports, or to locally apply inputs that were sent over
the network or saved to a file.

If `in_local_coords` is `false`, the event's position is in the embedder's
coordinates and will be converted to viewport coordinates. If
`in_local_coords` is `true`, the event's position is in viewport coordinates.

While this method serves a similar purpose as Input.parse_input_event(), it
does not remap the specified `event` based on project settings like
ProjectSettings.input_devices/pointing/emulate_touch_from_mouse.

Calling this method will propagate calls to child nodes for following methods
in the given order:

  * Node._input()

  * Control._gui_input() for Control nodes

  * Node._shortcut_input()

  * Node._unhandled_key_input()

  * Node._unhandled_input()

If an earlier method marks the input as handled via set_input_as_handled(),
any later method in this list will not be called.

If none of the methods handle the event and physics_object_picking is `true`,
the event is used for physics object picking.

void push_text_input(text: String)

Helper method which calls the `set_text()` method on the currently focused
Control, provided that it is defined (e.g. if the focused Control is Button or
LineEdit).

void push_unhandled_input(event: InputEvent, in_local_coords: bool = false)

Deprecated: Use push_input() instead.

Triggers the given `event` in this Viewport. This can be used to pass an
InputEvent between viewports, or to locally apply inputs that were sent over
the network or saved to a file.

If `in_local_coords` is `false`, the event's position is in the embedder's
coordinates and will be converted to viewport coordinates. If
`in_local_coords` is `true`, the event's position is in viewport coordinates.

Calling this method will propagate calls to child nodes for following methods
in the given order:

  * Node._shortcut_input()

  * Node._unhandled_key_input()

  * Node._unhandled_input()

If an earlier method marks the input as handled via set_input_as_handled(),
any later method in this list will not be called.

If none of the methods handle the event and physics_object_picking is `true`,
the event is used for physics object picking.

Note: This method doesn't propagate input events to embedded Windows or
SubViewports.

void set_canvas_cull_mask_bit(layer: int, enable: bool)

Set/clear individual bits on the rendering layer mask. This simplifies editing
this Viewport's layers.

void set_input_as_handled()

Stops the input from propagating further down the SceneTree.

Note: This does not affect the methods in Input, only the way events are
propagated.

void set_positional_shadow_atlas_quadrant_subdiv(quadrant: int, subdiv:
PositionalShadowAtlasQuadrantSubdiv)

Sets the number of subdivisions to use in the specified quadrant. A higher
number of subdivisions allows you to have more shadows in the scene at once,
but reduces the quality of the shadows. A good practice is to have quadrants
with a varying number of subdivisions and to have as few subdivisions as
possible.

void update_mouse_cursor_state()

Force instantly updating the display based on the current mouse cursor
position. This includes updating the mouse cursor shape and sending necessary
Control.mouse_entered, CollisionObject2D.mouse_entered,
CollisionObject3D.mouse_entered and Window.mouse_entered signals and their
respective `mouse_exited` counterparts.

void warp_mouse(position: Vector2)

Moves the mouse pointer to the specified position in this Viewport using the
coordinate system of this Viewport.

Note: warp_mouse() is only supported on Windows, macOS and Linux. It has no
effect on Android, iOS and Web.
