Abstract base class for 3D game objects affected by physics.

## Description

PhysicsBody3D is an abstract base class for 3D game objects affected by
physics. All 3D physics bodies inherit from it.

Warning: With a non-uniform scale, this node will likely not behave as
expected. It is advised to keep its scale the same on all axes and adjust its
collision shape(s) instead.

## Method Descriptions

void add_collision_exception_with(body: Node)

Adds a body to the list of bodies that this body can't collide with.

bool get_axis_lock(axis: BodyAxis) const

Returns `true` if the specified linear or rotational `axis` is locked.

Array[PhysicsBody3D] get_collision_exceptions()

Returns an array of nodes that were added as collision exceptions for this
body.

Vector3 get_gravity() const

Returns the gravity vector computed from all sources that can affect the body,
including all gravity overrides from Area3D nodes and the global world
gravity.

KinematicCollision3D move_and_collide(motion: Vector3, test_only: bool =
false, safe_margin: float = 0.001, recovery_as_collision: bool = false,
max_collisions: int = 1)

Moves the body along the vector `motion`. In order to be frame rate
independent in Node._physics_process() or Node._process(), `motion` should be
computed using `delta`.

The body will stop if it collides. Returns a KinematicCollision3D, which
contains information about the collision when stopped, or when touching
another body along the motion.

If `test_only` is `true`, the body does not move but the would-be collision
information is given.

`safe_margin` is the extra margin used for collision recovery (see
CharacterBody3D.safe_margin for more details).

If `recovery_as_collision` is `true`, any depenetration from the recovery
phase is also reported as a collision; this is used e.g. by CharacterBody3D
for improving floor detection during floor snapping.

`max_collisions` allows to retrieve more than one collision result.

void remove_collision_exception_with(body: Node)

Removes a body from the list of bodies that this body can't collide with.

void set_axis_lock(axis: BodyAxis, lock: bool)

Locks or unlocks the specified linear or rotational `axis` depending on the
value of `lock`.

bool test_move(from: Transform3D, motion: Vector3, collision:
KinematicCollision3D = null, safe_margin: float = 0.001,
recovery_as_collision: bool = false, max_collisions: int = 1)

Checks for collisions without moving the body. In order to be frame rate
independent in Node._physics_process() or Node._process(), `motion` should be
computed using `delta`.

Virtually sets the node's position, scale and rotation to that of the given
Transform3D, then tries to move the body along the vector `motion`. Returns
`true` if a collision would stop the body from moving along the whole path.

`collision` is an optional object of type KinematicCollision3D, which contains
additional information about the collision when stopped, or when touching
another body along the motion.

`safe_margin` is the extra margin used for collision recovery (see
CharacterBody3D.safe_margin for more details).

If `recovery_as_collision` is `true`, any depenetration from the recovery
phase is also reported as a collision; this is useful for checking whether the
body would touch any other bodies.

`max_collisions` allows to retrieve more than one collision result.
