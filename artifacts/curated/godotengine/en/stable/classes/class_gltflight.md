## Property Descriptions

Color color = `Color(1, 1, 1, 1)`

  * void set_color(value: Color)

  * Color get_color()

The Color of the light. Defaults to white. A black color causes the light to
have no effect.

float inner_cone_angle = `0.0`

  * void set_inner_cone_angle(value: float)

  * float get_inner_cone_angle()

The inner angle of the cone in a spotlight. Must be less than or equal to the
outer cone angle.

Within this angle, the light is at full brightness. Between the inner and
outer cone angles, there is a transition from full brightness to zero
brightness. When creating a Godot SpotLight3D, the ratio between the inner and
outer cone angles is used to calculate the attenuation of the light.

float intensity = `1.0`

  * void set_intensity(value: float)

  * float get_intensity()

The intensity of the light. This is expressed in candelas (lumens per
steradian) for point and spot lights, and lux (lumens per m) for directional
lights. When creating a Godot light, this value is converted to a unitless
multiplier.

String light_type = `""`

  * void set_light_type(value: String)

  * String get_light_type()

The type of the light. The values accepted by Godot are "point", "spot", and
"directional", which correspond to Godot's OmniLight3D, SpotLight3D, and
DirectionalLight3D respectively.

float outer_cone_angle = `0.785398`

  * void set_outer_cone_angle(value: float)

  * float get_outer_cone_angle()

The outer angle of the cone in a spotlight. Must be greater than or equal to
the inner angle.

At this angle, the light drops off to zero brightness. Between the inner and
outer cone angles, there is a transition from full brightness to zero
brightness. If this angle is a half turn, then the spotlight emits in all
directions. When creating a Godot SpotLight3D, the outer cone angle is used as
the angle of the spotlight.

float range = `inf`

  * void set_range(value: float)

  * float get_range()

The range of the light, beyond which the light has no effect. glTF lights with
no range defined behave like physical lights (which have infinite range). When
creating a Godot light, the range is clamped to 4096.

  *[static]: This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.
  *[void]: No return value.
  *[const]: This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.
