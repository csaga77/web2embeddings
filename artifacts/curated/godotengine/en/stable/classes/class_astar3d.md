# AStar3D

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

An implementation of A* for finding the shortest path between two vertices on
a connected graph in 3D space.

## Description

A* (A star) is a computer algorithm used in pathfinding and graph traversal,
the process of plotting short paths among vertices (points), passing through a
given set of edges (segments). It enjoys widespread use due to its performance
and accuracy. Godot's A* implementation uses points in 3D space and Euclidean
distances by default.

You must add points manually with add_point() and create segments manually
with connect_points(). Once done, you can test if there is a path between two
points with the are_points_connected() function, get a path containing indices
by get_id_path(), or one containing actual coordinates with get_point_path().

It is also possible to use non-Euclidean distances. To do so, create a script
that extends AStar3D and override the methods _compute_cost() and
_estimate_cost(). Both should take two point IDs and return the distance
between the corresponding points.

Example: Use Manhattan distance instead of Euclidean distance:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    class_name MyAStar3D
    extends AStar3D
    
    func _compute_cost(u, v):
        var u_pos = get_point_position(u)
        var v_pos = get_point_position(v)
        return abs(u_pos.x - v_pos.x) + abs(u_pos.y - v_pos.y) + abs(u_pos.z - v_pos.z)
    
    func _estimate_cost(u, v):
        var u_pos = get_point_position(u)
        var v_pos = get_point_position(v)
        return abs(u_pos.x - v_pos.x) + abs(u_pos.y - v_pos.y) + abs(u_pos.z - v_pos.z)
    
    
    
    using Godot;
    
    [GlobalClass]
    public partial class MyAStar3D : AStar3D
    {
        public override float _ComputeCost(long fromId, long toId)
        {
            Vector3 fromPoint = GetPointPosition(fromId);
            Vector3 toPoint = GetPointPosition(toId);
    
            return Mathf.Abs(fromPoint.X - toPoint.X) + Mathf.Abs(fromPoint.Y - toPoint.Y) + Mathf.Abs(fromPoint.Z - toPoint.Z);
        }
    
        public override float _EstimateCost(long fromId, long toId)
        {
            Vector3 fromPoint = GetPointPosition(fromId);
            Vector3 toPoint = GetPointPosition(toId);
            return Mathf.Abs(fromPoint.X - toPoint.X) + Mathf.Abs(fromPoint.Y - toPoint.Y) + Mathf.Abs(fromPoint.Z - toPoint.Z);
        }
    }
    

_estimate_cost() should return a lower bound of the distance, i.e.
`_estimate_cost(u, v) <= _compute_cost(u, v)`. This serves as a hint to the
algorithm because the custom _compute_cost() might be computation-heavy. If
this is not the case, make _estimate_cost() return the same value as
_compute_cost() to provide the algorithm with the most accurate information.

If the default _estimate_cost() and _compute_cost() methods are used, or if
the supplied _estimate_cost() method returns a lower bound of the cost, then
the paths returned by A* will be the lowest-cost paths. Here, the cost of a
path equals the sum of the _compute_cost() results of all segments in the path
multiplied by the `weight_scale`s of the endpoints of the respective segments.
If the default methods are used and the `weight_scale`s of all points are set
to `1.0`, then this equals the sum of Euclidean distances of all segments in
the path.

## Method Descriptions

float _compute_cost(from_id: int, to_id: int) virtual const

Called when computing the cost between two connected points.

Note that this function is hidden in the default AStar3D class.

float _estimate_cost(from_id: int, end_id: int) virtual const

Called when estimating the cost between a point and the path's ending point.

Note that this function is hidden in the default AStar3D class.

void add_point(id: int, position: Vector3, weight_scale: float = 1.0)

Adds a new point at the given position with the given identifier. The `id`
must be 0 or larger, and the `weight_scale` must be 0.0 or greater.

The `weight_scale` is multiplied by the result of _compute_cost() when
determining the overall cost of traveling across a segment from a neighboring
point to this point. Thus, all else being equal, the algorithm prefers points
with lower `weight_scale`s to form a path.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    var astar = AStar3D.new()
    astar.add_point(1, Vector3(1, 0, 0), 4) # Adds the point (1, 0, 0) with weight_scale 4 and id 1
    
    
    
    var astar = new AStar3D();
    astar.AddPoint(1, new Vector3(1, 0, 0), 4); // Adds the point (1, 0, 0) with weight_scale 4 and id 1
    

If there already exists a point for the given `id`, its position and weight
scale are updated to the given values.

bool are_points_connected(id: int, to_id: int, bidirectional: bool = true)
const

Returns whether the two given points are directly connected by a segment. If
`bidirectional` is `false`, returns whether movement from `id` to `to_id` is
possible through this segment.

void clear()

Clears all the points and segments.

void connect_points(id: int, to_id: int, bidirectional: bool = true)

Creates a segment between the given points. If `bidirectional` is `false`,
only movement from `id` to `to_id` is allowed, not the reverse direction.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    var astar = AStar3D.new()
    astar.add_point(1, Vector3(1, 1, 0))
    astar.add_point(2, Vector3(0, 5, 0))
    astar.connect_points(1, 2, false)
    
    
    
    var astar = new AStar3D();
    astar.AddPoint(1, new Vector3(1, 1, 0));
    astar.AddPoint(2, new Vector3(0, 5, 0));
    astar.ConnectPoints(1, 2, false);
    

void disconnect_points(id: int, to_id: int, bidirectional: bool = true)

Deletes the segment between the given points. If `bidirectional` is `false`,
only movement from `id` to `to_id` is prevented, and a unidirectional segment
possibly remains.

int get_available_point_id() const

Returns the next available point ID with no point associated to it.

int get_closest_point(to_position: Vector3, include_disabled: bool = false)
const

Returns the ID of the closest point to `to_position`, optionally taking
disabled points into account. Returns `-1` if there are no points in the
points pool.

Note: If several points are the closest to `to_position`, the one with the
smallest ID will be returned, ensuring a deterministic result.

Vector3 get_closest_position_in_segment(to_position: Vector3) const

Returns the closest position to `to_position` that resides inside a segment
between two connected points.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    var astar = AStar3D.new()
    astar.add_point(1, Vector3(0, 0, 0))
    astar.add_point(2, Vector3(0, 5, 0))
    astar.connect_points(1, 2)
    var res = astar.get_closest_position_in_segment(Vector3(3, 3, 0)) # Returns (0, 3, 0)
    
    
    
    var astar = new AStar3D();
    astar.AddPoint(1, new Vector3(0, 0, 0));
    astar.AddPoint(2, new Vector3(0, 5, 0));
    astar.ConnectPoints(1, 2);
    Vector3 res = astar.GetClosestPositionInSegment(new Vector3(3, 3, 0)); // Returns (0, 3, 0)
    

The result is in the segment that goes from `y = 0` to `y = 5`. It's the
closest position in the segment to the given point.

PackedInt64Array get_id_path(from_id: int, to_id: int, allow_partial_path:
bool = false)

Returns an array with the IDs of the points that form the path found by
AStar3D between the given points. The array is ordered from the starting point
to the ending point of the path.

If there is no valid path to the target, and `allow_partial_path` is `true`,
returns a path to the point closest to the target that can be reached.

Note: When `allow_partial_path` is `true` and `to_id` is disabled the search
may take an unusually long time to finish.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    var astar = AStar3D.new()
    astar.add_point(1, Vector3(0, 0, 0))
    astar.add_point(2, Vector3(0, 1, 0), 1) # Default weight is 1
    astar.add_point(3, Vector3(1, 1, 0))
    astar.add_point(4, Vector3(2, 0, 0))
    
    astar.connect_points(1, 2, false)
    astar.connect_points(2, 3, false)
    astar.connect_points(4, 3, false)
    astar.connect_points(1, 4, false)
    
    var res = astar.get_id_path(1, 3) # Returns [1, 2, 3]
    
    
    
    var astar = new AStar3D();
    astar.AddPoint(1, new Vector3(0, 0, 0));
    astar.AddPoint(2, new Vector3(0, 1, 0), 1); // Default weight is 1
    astar.AddPoint(3, new Vector3(1, 1, 0));
    astar.AddPoint(4, new Vector3(2, 0, 0));
    astar.ConnectPoints(1, 2, false);
    astar.ConnectPoints(2, 3, false);
    astar.ConnectPoints(4, 3, false);
    astar.ConnectPoints(1, 4, false);
    long[] res = astar.GetIdPath(1, 3); // Returns [1, 2, 3]
    

If you change the 2nd point's weight to 3, then the result will be `[1, 4, 3]`
instead, because now even though the distance is longer, it's "easier" to get
through point 4 than through point 2.

int get_point_capacity() const

Returns the capacity of the structure backing the points, useful in
conjunction with reserve_space().

PackedInt64Array get_point_connections(id: int)

Returns an array with the IDs of the points that form the connection with the
given point.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    var astar = AStar3D.new()
    astar.add_point(1, Vector3(0, 0, 0))
    astar.add_point(2, Vector3(0, 1, 0))
    astar.add_point(3, Vector3(1, 1, 0))
    astar.add_point(4, Vector3(2, 0, 0))
    
    astar.connect_points(1, 2, true)
    astar.connect_points(1, 3, true)
    
    var neighbors = astar.get_point_connections(1) # Returns [2, 3]
    
    
    
    var astar = new AStar3D();
    astar.AddPoint(1, new Vector3(0, 0, 0));
    astar.AddPoint(2, new Vector3(0, 1, 0));
    astar.AddPoint(3, new Vector3(1, 1, 0));
    astar.AddPoint(4, new Vector3(2, 0, 0));
    astar.ConnectPoints(1, 2, true);
    astar.ConnectPoints(1, 3, true);
    
    long[] neighbors = astar.GetPointConnections(1); // Returns [2, 3]
    

int get_point_count() const

Returns the number of points currently in the points pool.

PackedInt64Array get_point_ids()

Returns an array of all point IDs.

PackedVector3Array get_point_path(from_id: int, to_id: int,
allow_partial_path: bool = false)

Returns an array with the points that are in the path found by AStar3D between
the given points. The array is ordered from the starting point to the ending
point of the path.

If there is no valid path to the target, and `allow_partial_path` is `true`,
returns a path to the point closest to the target that can be reached.

Note: This method is not thread-safe. If called from a Thread, it will return
an empty array and will print an error message.

Additionally, when `allow_partial_path` is `true` and `to_id` is disabled the
search may take an unusually long time to finish.

Vector3 get_point_position(id: int) const

Returns the position of the point associated with the given `id`.

float get_point_weight_scale(id: int) const

Returns the weight scale of the point associated with the given `id`.

bool has_point(id: int) const

Returns whether a point associated with the given `id` exists.

bool is_point_disabled(id: int) const

Returns whether a point is disabled or not for pathfinding. By default, all
points are enabled.

void remove_point(id: int)

Removes the point associated with the given `id` from the points pool.

void reserve_space(num_nodes: int)

Reserves space internally for `num_nodes` points. Useful if you're adding a
known large number of points at once, such as points on a grid. New capacity
must be greater or equals to old capacity.

void set_point_disabled(id: int, disabled: bool = true)

Disables or enables the specified point for pathfinding. Useful for making a
temporary obstacle.

void set_point_position(id: int, position: Vector3)

Sets the `position` for the point with the given `id`.

void set_point_weight_scale(id: int, weight_scale: float)

Sets the `weight_scale` for the point with the given `id`. The `weight_scale`
is multiplied by the result of _compute_cost() when determining the overall
cost of traveling across a segment from a neighboring point to this point.
