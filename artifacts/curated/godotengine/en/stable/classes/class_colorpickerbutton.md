# ColorPickerButton

Inherits: Button < BaseButton < Control < CanvasItem < Node < Object

A button that brings up a ColorPicker when pressed.

## Description

Encapsulates a ColorPicker, making it accessible by pressing a button.
Pressing the button will toggle the ColorPicker's visibility.

See also BaseButton which contains common properties and methods associated
with this node.

Note: By default, the button may not be wide enough for the color preview
swatch to be visible. Make sure to set Control.custom_minimum_size to a big
enough value to give the button enough space.
