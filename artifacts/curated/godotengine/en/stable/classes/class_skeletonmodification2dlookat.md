# SkeletonModification2DLookAt

Experimental: This class may be changed or removed in future versions.

Inherits: SkeletonModification2D < Resource < RefCounted < Object

A modification that rotates a Bone2D node to look at a target.

## Description

This SkeletonModification2D rotates a bone to look a target. This is extremely
helpful for moving character's head to look at the player, rotating a turret
to look at a target, or any other case where you want to make a bone rotate
towards something quickly and easily.

## Properties

NodePath | bone2d_node | `NodePath("")`  
---|---|---  
int | bone_index | `-1`  
NodePath | target_nodepath | `NodePath("")`

## Property Descriptions

NodePath bone2d_node = `NodePath("")`

  * void set_bone2d_node(value: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_bone2d_node()

The Bone2D node that the modification will operate on.

int bone_index = `-1`

  * void set_bone_index(value: int)

  * int get_bone_index()

The index of the Bone2D node that the modification will operate on.

NodePath target_nodepath = `NodePath("")`

  * void set_target_node(value: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_target_node()

The NodePath to the node that is the target for the LookAt modification. This
node is what the modification will rotate the Bone2D to.

## Method Descriptions

float get_additional_rotation() const

Returns the amount of additional rotation that is applied after the LookAt
modification executes.

bool get_constraint_angle_invert() const

Returns whether the constraints to this modification are inverted or not.

float get_constraint_angle_max() const

Returns the constraint's maximum allowed angle.

float get_constraint_angle_min() const

Returns the constraint's minimum allowed angle.

bool get_enable_constraint() const

Returns `true` if the LookAt modification is using constraints.

void set_additional_rotation(rotation: float)

Sets the amount of additional rotation that is to be applied after executing
the modification. This allows for offsetting the results by the inputted
rotation amount.

void set_constraint_angle_invert(invert: bool)

When `true`, the modification will use an inverted joint constraint.

An inverted joint constraint only constraints the Bone2D to the angles outside
of the inputted minimum and maximum angles. For this reason, it is referred to
as an inverted joint constraint, as it constraints the joint to the outside of
the inputted values.

void set_constraint_angle_max(angle_max: float)

Sets the constraint's maximum allowed angle.

void set_constraint_angle_min(angle_min: float)

Sets the constraint's minimum allowed angle.

void set_enable_constraint(enable_constraint: bool)

Sets whether this modification will use constraints or not. When `true`,
constraints will be applied when solving the LookAt modification.
