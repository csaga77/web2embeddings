## Enumerations

enum CompressionMode:

CompressionMode COMPRESS_NONE = `0`

No compression. This uses the most bandwidth, but has the upside of requiring
the fewest CPU resources. This option may also be used to make network
debugging using tools like Wireshark easier.

CompressionMode COMPRESS_RANGE_CODER = `1`

ENet's built-in range encoding. Works well on small packets, but is not the
most efficient algorithm on packets larger than 4 KB.

CompressionMode COMPRESS_FASTLZ = `2`

FastLZ compression. This option uses less CPU resources compared to
COMPRESS_ZLIB, at the expense of using more bandwidth.

CompressionMode COMPRESS_ZLIB = `3`

Zlib compression. This option uses less bandwidth compared to COMPRESS_FASTLZ,
at the expense of using more CPU resources.

CompressionMode COMPRESS_ZSTD = `4`

Zstandard compression. Note that this algorithm is not very efficient on
packets smaller than 4 KB. Therefore, it's recommended to use other
compression algorithms in most cases.

enum EventType:

EventType EVENT_ERROR = `-1`

An error occurred during service(). You will likely need to destroy() the host
and recreate it.

EventType EVENT_NONE = `0`

No event occurred within the specified time limit.

EventType EVENT_CONNECT = `1`

A connection request initiated by enet_host_connect has completed. The array
will contain the peer which successfully connected.

EventType EVENT_DISCONNECT = `2`

A peer has disconnected. This event is generated on a successful completion of
a disconnect initiated by ENetPacketPeer.peer_disconnect(), if a peer has
timed out, or if a connection request initialized by connect_to_host() has
timed out. The array will contain the peer which disconnected. The data field
contains user supplied data describing the disconnection, or 0, if none is
available.

EventType EVENT_RECEIVE = `3`

A packet has been received from a peer. The array will contain the peer which
sent the packet and the channel number upon which the packet was received. The
received packet will be queued to the associated ENetPacketPeer.

enum HostStatistic:

HostStatistic HOST_TOTAL_SENT_DATA = `0`

Total data sent.

HostStatistic HOST_TOTAL_SENT_PACKETS = `1`

Total UDP packets sent.

HostStatistic HOST_TOTAL_RECEIVED_DATA = `2`

Total data received.

HostStatistic HOST_TOTAL_RECEIVED_PACKETS = `3`

Total UDP packets received.

## Method Descriptions

void bandwidth_limit(in_bandwidth: int = 0, out_bandwidth: int = 0)

Adjusts the bandwidth limits of a host.

void broadcast(channel: int, packet: PackedByteArray, flags: int)

Queues a `packet` to be sent to all peers associated with the host over the
specified `channel`. See ENetPacketPeer `FLAG_*` constants for available
packet flags.

void channel_limit(limit: int)

Limits the maximum allowed channels of future incoming connections.

void compress(mode: CompressionMode)

Sets the compression method used for network packets. These have different
tradeoffs of compression speed versus bandwidth, you may need to test which
one works best for your use case if you use compression at all.

Note: Most games' network design involve sending many small packets frequently
(smaller than 4 KB each). If in doubt, it is recommended to keep the default
compression algorithm as it works best on these small packets.

Note: The compression mode must be set to the same value on both the server
and all its clients. Clients will fail to connect if the compression mode set
on the client differs from the one set on the server.

ENetPacketPeer connect_to_host(address: String, port: int, channels: int = 0,
data: int = 0)

Initiates a connection to a foreign `address` using the specified `port` and
allocating the requested `channels`. Optional `data` can be passed during
connection in the form of a 32 bit integer.

Note: You must call either create_host() or create_host_bound() on both ends
before calling this method.

Error create_host(max_peers: int = 32, max_channels: int = 0, in_bandwidth:
int = 0, out_bandwidth: int = 0)

Creates an ENetHost that allows up to `max_peers` connected peers, each
allocating up to `max_channels` channels, optionally limiting bandwidth to
`in_bandwidth` and `out_bandwidth` (if greater than zero).

This method binds a random available dynamic UDP port on the host machine at
the unspecified address. Use create_host_bound() to specify the address and
port.

Note: It is necessary to create a host in both client and server in order to
establish a connection.

Error create_host_bound(bind_address: String, bind_port: int, max_peers: int =
32, max_channels: int = 0, in_bandwidth: int = 0, out_bandwidth: int = 0)

Creates an ENetHost bound to the given `bind_address` and `bind_port` that
allows up to `max_peers` connected peers, each allocating up to `max_channels`
channels, optionally limiting bandwidth to `in_bandwidth` and `out_bandwidth`
(if greater than zero).

Note: It is necessary to create a host in both client and server in order to
establish a connection.

void destroy()

Destroys the host and all resources associated with it.

Error dtls_client_setup(hostname: String, client_options: TLSOptions = null)

Configure this ENetHost to use the custom Godot extension allowing DTLS
encryption for ENet clients. Call this before connect_to_host() to have ENet
connect using DTLS validating the server certificate against `hostname`. You
can pass the optional `client_options` parameter to customize the trusted
certification authorities, or disable the common name verification. See
TLSOptions.client() and TLSOptions.client_unsafe().

Error dtls_server_setup(server_options: TLSOptions)

Configure this ENetHost to use the custom Godot extension allowing DTLS
encryption for ENet servers. Call this right after create_host_bound() to have
ENet expect peers to connect using DTLS. See TLSOptions.server().

void flush()

Sends any queued packets on the host specified to its designated peers.

int get_local_port() const

Returns the local port to which this peer is bound.

int get_max_channels() const

Returns the maximum number of channels allowed for connected peers.

Array[ENetPacketPeer] get_peers()

Returns the list of peers associated with this host.

Note: This list might include some peers that are not fully connected or are
still being disconnected.

float pop_statistic(statistic: HostStatistic)

Returns and resets host statistics. See HostStatistic for more info.

void refuse_new_connections(refuse: bool)

Configures the DTLS server to automatically drop new connections.

Note: This method is only relevant after calling dtls_server_setup().

Array service(timeout: int = 0)

Waits for events on this connection and shuttles packets between the host and
its peers, with the given `timeout` (in milliseconds). The returned Array will
have 4 elements. An EventType, the ENetPacketPeer which generated the event,
the event associated data (if any), the event associated channel (if any). If
the generated event is EVENT_RECEIVE, the received packet will be queued to
the associated ENetPacketPeer.

Call this function regularly to handle connections, disconnections, and to
receive new packets.

Note: This method must be called on both ends involved in the event (sending
and receiving hosts).

void socket_send(destination_address: String, destination_port: int, packet:
PackedByteArray)

Sends a `packet` toward a destination from the address and port currently
bound by this ENetConnection instance.

This is useful as it serves to establish entries in NAT routing tables on all
devices between this bound instance and the public facing internet, allowing a
prospective client's connection packets to be routed backward through the NAT
device(s) between the public internet and this host.

This requires forward knowledge of a prospective client's address and
communication port as seen by the public internet - after any NAT devices have
handled their connection request. This information can be obtained by a STUN
service, and must be handed off to your host by an entity that is not the
prospective client. This will never work for a client behind a Symmetric NAT
due to the nature of the Symmetric NAT routing algorithm, as their IP and Port
cannot be known beforehand.
