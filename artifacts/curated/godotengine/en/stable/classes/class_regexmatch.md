# RegExMatch

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Contains the results of a RegEx search.

## Description

Contains the results of a single RegEx match returned by RegEx.search() and
RegEx.search_all(). It can be used to find the position and range of the match
and its capturing groups, and it can extract its substring for you.

## Properties

Dictionary | names | `{}`  
---|---|---  
PackedStringArray | strings | `PackedStringArray()`  
String | subject | `""`  
  
## Methods

int | get_end(name: Variant = 0) const  
---|---  
int | get_group_count() const  
int | get_start(name: Variant = 0) const  
String | get_string(name: Variant = 0) const  
  
## Property Descriptions

Dictionary names = `{}`

  * Dictionary get_names()

A dictionary of named groups and its corresponding group number. Only groups
that were matched are included. If multiple groups have the same name, that
name would refer to the first matching one.

PackedStringArray strings = `PackedStringArray()`

  * PackedStringArray get_strings()

An Array of the match and its capturing groups.

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedStringArray for more details.

String subject = `""`

  * String get_subject()

The source string used with the search pattern to find this matching result.

## Method Descriptions

int get_end(name: Variant = 0) const

Returns the end position of the match within the source string. The end
position of capturing groups can be retrieved by providing its group number as
an integer or its string name (if it's a named group). The default value of 0
refers to the whole pattern.

Returns -1 if the group did not match or doesn't exist.

int get_group_count() const

Returns the number of capturing groups.

int get_start(name: Variant = 0) const

Returns the starting position of the match within the source string. The
starting position of capturing groups can be retrieved by providing its group
number as an integer or its string name (if it's a named group). The default
value of 0 refers to the whole pattern.

Returns -1 if the group did not match or doesn't exist.

String get_string(name: Variant = 0) const

Returns the substring of the match from the source string. Capturing groups
can be retrieved by providing its group number as an integer or its string
name (if it's a named group). The default value of 0 refers to the whole
pattern.

Returns an empty string if the group did not match or doesn't exist.
