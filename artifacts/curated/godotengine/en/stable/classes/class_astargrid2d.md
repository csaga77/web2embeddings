# AStarGrid2D

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

An implementation of A* for finding the shortest path between two points on a
partial 2D grid.

## Description

AStarGrid2D is a variant of AStar2D that is specialized for partial 2D grids.
It is simpler to use because it doesn't require you to manually create points
and connect them together. This class also supports multiple types of
heuristics, modes for diagonal movement, and a jumping mode to speed up
calculations.

To use AStarGrid2D, you only need to set the region of the grid, optionally
set the cell_size, and then call the update() method:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    var astar_grid = AStarGrid2D.new()
    astar_grid.region = Rect2i(0, 0, 32, 32)
    astar_grid.cell_size = Vector2(16, 16)
    astar_grid.update()
    print(astar_grid.get_id_path(Vector2i(0, 0), Vector2i(3, 4))) # Prints [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)]
    print(astar_grid.get_point_path(Vector2i(0, 0), Vector2i(3, 4))) # Prints [(0, 0), (16, 16), (32, 32), (48, 48), (48, 64)]
    
    
    
    AStarGrid2D astarGrid = new AStarGrid2D();
    astarGrid.Region = new Rect2I(0, 0, 32, 32);
    astarGrid.CellSize = new Vector2I(16, 16);
    astarGrid.Update();
    GD.Print(astarGrid.GetIdPath(Vector2I.Zero, new Vector2I(3, 4))); // Prints [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)]
    GD.Print(astarGrid.GetPointPath(Vector2I.Zero, new Vector2I(3, 4))); // Prints [(0, 0), (16, 16), (32, 32), (48, 48), (48, 64)]
    

To remove a point from the pathfinding grid, it must be set as "solid" with
set_point_solid().

## Enumerations

enum Heuristic:

Heuristic HEURISTIC_EUCLIDEAN = `0`

The Euclidean heuristic to be used for the pathfinding using the following
formula:

    
    
    dx = abs(to_id.x - from_id.x)
    dy = abs(to_id.y - from_id.y)
    result = sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy)
    

Note: This is also the internal heuristic used in AStar3D and AStar2D by
default (with the inclusion of possible z-axis coordinate).

Heuristic HEURISTIC_MANHATTAN = `1`

The Manhattan heuristic to be used for the pathfinding using the following
formula:

    
    
    dx = abs(to_id.x - from_id.x)
    dy = abs(to_id.y - from_id.y)
    result = dx + dy
    

Note: This heuristic is intended to be used with 4-side orthogonal movements,
provided by setting the diagonal_mode to DIAGONAL_MODE_NEVER.

Heuristic HEURISTIC_OCTILE = `2`

The Octile heuristic to be used for the pathfinding using the following
formula:

    
    
    dx = abs(to_id.x - from_id.x)
    dy = abs(to_id.y - from_id.y)
    f = sqrt(2) - 1
    result = (dx < dy) ? f * dx + dy : f * dy + dx;
    

Heuristic HEURISTIC_CHEBYSHEV = `3`

The Chebyshev heuristic to be used for the pathfinding using the following
formula:

    
    
    dx = abs(to_id.x - from_id.x)
    dy = abs(to_id.y - from_id.y)
    result = max(dx, dy)

DiagonalMode DIAGONAL_MODE_ALWAYS = `0`

The pathfinding algorithm will ignore solid neighbors around the target cell
and allow passing using diagonals.

The pathfinding algorithm will ignore all diagonals and the way will be always
orthogonal.

DiagonalMode DIAGONAL_MODE_AT_LEAST_ONE_WALKABLE = `2`

The pathfinding algorithm will avoid using diagonals if at least two obstacles
have been placed around the neighboring cells of the specific path segment.

DiagonalMode DIAGONAL_MODE_ONLY_IF_NO_OBSTACLES = `3`

The pathfinding algorithm will avoid using diagonals if any obstacle has been
placed around the neighboring cells of the specific path segment.

Represents the size of the DiagonalMode enum.

enum CellShape:

CellShape CELL_SHAPE_SQUARE = `0`

Rectangular cell shape.

CellShape CELL_SHAPE_ISOMETRIC_RIGHT = `1`

## Property Descriptions

CellShape cell_shape = `0`

  * void set_cell_shape(value: CellShape)

update() needs to be called before finding the next path.

Vector2 cell_size = `Vector2(1, 1)`

  * void set_cell_size(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_cell_size()

The size of the point cell which will be applied to calculate the resulting
point position returned by get_point_path(). If changed, update() needs to be
called before finding the next path.

Heuristic default_compute_heuristic = `0`

  * void set_default_compute_heuristic(value: Heuristic)

  * Heuristic get_default_compute_heuristic()

The default Heuristic which will be used to calculate the cost between two
points if _compute_cost() was not overridden.

Heuristic default_estimate_heuristic = `0`

  * Heuristic get_default_estimate_heuristic()

The default Heuristic which will be used to calculate the cost between the
point and the end point if _estimate_cost() was not overridden.

DiagonalMode diagonal_mode = `0`

  * void set_diagonal_mode(value: DiagonalMode)

  * DiagonalMode get_diagonal_mode()

A specific DiagonalMode mode which will force the path to avoid or accept the
specified diagonals.

bool jumping_enabled = `false`

  * void set_jumping_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_jumping_enabled()

Enables or disables jumping to skip up the intermediate points and speeds up
the searching algorithm.

Note: Currently, toggling it on disables the consideration of weight scaling
in pathfinding.

Vector2 offset = `Vector2(0, 0)`

  * void set_offset(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_offset()

The offset of the grid which will be applied to calculate the resulting point
position returned by get_point_path(). If changed, update() needs to be called
before finding the next path.

Rect2i region = `Rect2i(0, 0, 0, 0)`

  * void set_region(value: Rect2i)

  * Rect2i get_region()

The region of grid cells available for pathfinding. If changed, update() needs
to be called before finding the next path.

Vector2i size = `Vector2i(0, 0)`

  * void set_size(value: Vector2i)

  * Vector2i get_size()

Deprecated: Use region instead.

The size of the grid (number of cells of size cell_size on each axis). If
changed, update() needs to be called before finding the next path.

## Method Descriptions

float _compute_cost(from_id: Vector2i, to_id: Vector2i) virtual const

Called when computing the cost between two connected points.

Note that this function is hidden in the default AStarGrid2D class.

float _estimate_cost(from_id: Vector2i, end_id: Vector2i) virtual const

Called when estimating the cost between a point and the path's ending point.

Note that this function is hidden in the default AStarGrid2D class.

void clear()

Clears the grid and sets the region to `Rect2i(0, 0, 0, 0)`.

void fill_solid_region(region: Rect2i, solid: bool = true)

Fills the given `region` on the grid with the specified value for the solid
flag.

Note: Calling update() is not needed after the call of this function.

void fill_weight_scale_region(region: Rect2i, weight_scale: float)

Fills the given `region` on the grid with the specified value for the weight
scale.

Note: Calling update() is not needed after the call of this function.

Array[Vector2i] get_id_path(from_id: Vector2i, to_id: Vector2i,
allow_partial_path: bool = false)

Returns an array with the IDs of the points that form the path found by
AStar2D between the given points. The array is ordered from the starting point
to the ending point of the path.

If there is no valid path to the target, and `allow_partial_path` is `true`,
returns a path to the point closest to the target that can be reached.

Note: When `allow_partial_path` is `true` and `to_id` is solid the search may
take an unusually long time to finish.

Array[Dictionary] get_point_data_in_region(region: Rect2i) const

Returns an array of dictionaries with point data (`id`: Vector2i, `position`:
Vector2, `solid`: bool, `weight_scale`: float) within a `region`.

PackedVector2Array get_point_path(from_id: Vector2i, to_id: Vector2i,
allow_partial_path: bool = false)

Returns an array with the points that are in the path found by AStarGrid2D
between the given points. The array is ordered from the starting point to the
ending point of the path.

If there is no valid path to the target, and `allow_partial_path` is `true`,
returns a path to the point closest to the target that can be reached.

Note: This method is not thread-safe. If called from a Thread, it will return
an empty array and will print an error message.

Additionally, when `allow_partial_path` is `true` and `to_id` is solid the
search may take an unusually long time to finish.

Vector2 get_point_position(id: Vector2i) const

Returns the position of the point associated with the given `id`.

float get_point_weight_scale(id: Vector2i) const

Returns the weight scale of the point associated with the given `id`.

bool is_dirty() const

Indicates that the grid parameters were changed and update() needs to be
called.

bool is_in_bounds(x: int, y: int) const

Returns `true` if the `x` and `y` is a valid grid coordinate (id), i.e. if it
is inside region. Equivalent to `region.has_point(Vector2i(x, y))`.

bool is_in_boundsv(id: Vector2i) const

Returns `true` if the `id` vector is a valid grid coordinate, i.e. if it is
inside region. Equivalent to `region.has_point(id)`.

bool is_point_solid(id: Vector2i) const

Returns `true` if a point is disabled for pathfinding. By default, all points
are enabled.

void set_point_solid(id: Vector2i, solid: bool = true)

Disables or enables the specified point for pathfinding. Useful for making an
obstacle. By default, all points are enabled.

Note: Calling update() is not needed after the call of this function.

void set_point_weight_scale(id: Vector2i, weight_scale: float)

Sets the `weight_scale` for the point with the given `id`. The `weight_scale`
is multiplied by the result of _compute_cost() when determining the overall
cost of traveling across a segment from a neighboring point to this point.

Note: Calling update() is not needed after the call of this function.

void update()

Updates the internal state of the grid according to the parameters to prepare
it to search the path. Needs to be called if parameters like region, cell_size
or offset are changed. is_dirty() will return `true` if this is the case and
this needs to be called.

Note: All point data (solidity and weight scale) will be cleared.
