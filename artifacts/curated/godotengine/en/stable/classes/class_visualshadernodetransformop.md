# VisualShaderNodeTransformOp

Inherits: VisualShaderNode < Resource < RefCounted < Object

A Transform3D operator to be used within the visual shader graph.

## Description

Applies operator to two transform (44 matrices) inputs.

## Properties

Operator | operator | `0`  
---|---|---  
  
## Enumerations

enum Operator:

Operator OP_AxB = `0`

Multiplies transform `a` by the transform `b`.

Operator OP_BxA = `1`

Multiplies transform `b` by the transform `a`.

Operator OP_AxB_COMP = `2`

Performs a component-wise multiplication of transform `a` by the transform
`b`.

Operator OP_BxA_COMP = `3`

Performs a component-wise multiplication of transform `b` by the transform
`a`.

Operator OP_ADD = `4`

Adds two transforms.

Operator OP_A_MINUS_B = `5`

Subtracts the transform `a` from the transform `b`.

Operator OP_B_MINUS_A = `6`

Subtracts the transform `b` from the transform `a`.

Operator OP_A_DIV_B = `7`

Divides the transform `a` by the transform `b`.

Operator OP_B_DIV_A = `8`

Divides the transform `b` by the transform `a`.

Operator OP_MAX = `9`

Represents the size of the Operator enum.

## Property Descriptions
