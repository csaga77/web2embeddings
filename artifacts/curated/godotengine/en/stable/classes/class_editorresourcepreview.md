# EditorResourcePreview

Inherits: Node < Object

A node used to generate previews of resources or files.

## Description

This node is used to generate previews for resources or files.

Note: This class shouldn't be instantiated directly. Instead, access the
singleton using EditorInterface.get_resource_previewer().

## Methods

void | add_preview_generator(generator: EditorResourcePreviewGenerator)  
---|---  
void | check_for_invalidation(path: String)  
void | queue_edited_resource_preview(resource: Resource, receiver: Object, receiver_func: StringName, userdata: Variant)  
void | queue_resource_preview(path: String, receiver: Object, receiver_func: StringName, userdata: Variant)  
void | remove_preview_generator(generator: EditorResourcePreviewGenerator)  
  
## Signals

preview_invalidated(path: String)

Emitted if a preview was invalidated (changed). `path` corresponds to the path
of the preview.

## Method Descriptions

void add_preview_generator(generator: EditorResourcePreviewGenerator)

Create an own, custom preview generator.

void check_for_invalidation(path: String)

Check if the resource changed, if so, it will be invalidated and the
corresponding signal emitted.

void queue_edited_resource_preview(resource: Resource, receiver: Object,
receiver_func: StringName, userdata: Variant)

Queue the `resource` being edited for preview. Once the preview is ready, the
`receiver`'s `receiver_func` will be called. The `receiver_func` must take the
following four arguments: String path, Texture2D preview, Texture2D
thumbnail_preview, Variant userdata. `userdata` can be anything, and will be
returned when `receiver_func` is called.

Note: If it was not possible to create the preview the `receiver_func` will
still be called, but the preview will be `null`.

void queue_resource_preview(path: String, receiver: Object, receiver_func:
StringName, userdata: Variant)

Queue a resource file located at `path` for preview. Once the preview is
ready, the `receiver`'s `receiver_func` will be called. The `receiver_func`
must take the following four arguments: String path, Texture2D preview,
Texture2D thumbnail_preview, Variant userdata. `userdata` can be anything, and
will be returned when `receiver_func` is called.

Note: If it was not possible to create the preview the `receiver_func` will
still be called, but the preview will be `null`.

void remove_preview_generator(generator: EditorResourcePreviewGenerator)

Removes a custom preview generator.
