## Methods

GDExtension | get_extension(path: String)  
---|---  
PackedStringArray | get_loaded_extensions() const  
bool | is_extension_loaded(path: String) const  
LoadStatus | load_extension(path: String)  
LoadStatus | reload_extension(path: String)  
LoadStatus | unload_extension(path: String)  
  
## Signals

extension_loaded(extension: GDExtension)

Emitted after the editor has finished loading a new extension.

Note: This signal is only emitted in editor builds.

extension_unloading(extension: GDExtension)

Emitted before the editor starts unloading an extension.

Note: This signal is only emitted in editor builds.

extensions_reloaded()

Emitted after the editor has finished reloading one or more extensions.

## Enumerations

enum LoadStatus:

LoadStatus LOAD_STATUS_OK = `0`

The extension has loaded successfully.

LoadStatus LOAD_STATUS_FAILED = `1`

The extension has failed to load, possibly because it does not exist or has
missing dependencies.

LoadStatus LOAD_STATUS_ALREADY_LOADED = `2`

The extension has already been loaded.

LoadStatus LOAD_STATUS_NOT_LOADED = `3`

The extension has not been loaded.

LoadStatus LOAD_STATUS_NEEDS_RESTART = `4`

The extension requires the application to restart to fully load.

## Method Descriptions

GDExtension get_extension(path: String)

Returns the GDExtension at the given file `path`, or `null` if it has not been
loaded or does not exist.

PackedStringArray get_loaded_extensions() const

Returns the file paths of all currently loaded extensions.

bool is_extension_loaded(path: String) const

Returns `true` if the extension at the given file `path` has already been
loaded successfully. See also get_loaded_extensions().

LoadStatus load_extension(path: String)

Loads an extension by absolute file path. The `path` needs to point to a valid
GDExtension. Returns LOAD_STATUS_OK if successful.

LoadStatus reload_extension(path: String)

Reloads the extension at the given file path. The `path` needs to point to a
valid GDExtension, otherwise this method may return either
LOAD_STATUS_NOT_LOADED or LOAD_STATUS_FAILED.

Note: You can only reload extensions in the editor. In release builds, this
method always fails and returns LOAD_STATUS_FAILED.

LoadStatus unload_extension(path: String)

Unloads an extension by file path. The `path` needs to point to an already
loaded GDExtension, otherwise this method returns LOAD_STATUS_NOT_LOADED.
