# SkeletonModificationStack2D

Experimental: This class may be changed or removed in future versions.

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

A resource that holds a stack of SkeletonModification2Ds.

## Description

This resource is used by the Skeleton and holds a stack of
SkeletonModification2Ds.

This controls the order of the modifications and how they are applied.
Modification order is especially important for full-body IK setups, as you
need to execute the modifications in the correct order to get the desired
results. For example, you want to execute a modification on the spine before
the arms on a humanoid skeleton.

This resource also controls how strongly all of the modifications are applied
to the Skeleton2D.

## Properties

bool | enabled | `false`  
---|---|---  
int | modification_count | `0`  
float | strength | `1.0`  
  
## Methods

void | add_modification(modification: SkeletonModification2D)  
---|---  
void | delete_modification(mod_idx: int)  
void | enable_all_modifications(enabled: bool)  
void | execute(delta: float, execution_mode: int)  
bool | get_is_setup() const  
SkeletonModification2D | get_modification(mod_idx: int) const  
Skeleton2D | get_skeleton() const  
void | set_modification(mod_idx: int, modification: SkeletonModification2D)  
void | setup()  
  
## Property Descriptions

bool enabled = `false`

  * void set_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool get_enabled()

If `true`, the modification's in the stack will be called. This is handled
automatically through the Skeleton2D node.

int modification_count = `0`

  * void set_modification_count(value: int)

  * int get_modification_count()

The number of modifications in the stack.

float strength = `1.0`

  * void set_strength(value: float)

  * float get_strength()

The interpolation strength of the modifications in stack. A value of `0` will
make it where the modifications are not applied, a strength of `0.5` will be
half applied, and a strength of `1` will allow the modifications to be fully
applied and override the Skeleton2D Bone2D poses.

## Method Descriptions

void add_modification(modification: SkeletonModification2D)

Adds the passed-in SkeletonModification2D to the stack.

void delete_modification(mod_idx: int)

Deletes the SkeletonModification2D at the index position `mod_idx`, if it
exists.

void enable_all_modifications(enabled: bool)

Enables all SkeletonModification2Ds in the stack.

void execute(delta: float, execution_mode: int)

Executes all of the SkeletonModification2Ds in the stack that use the same
execution mode as the passed-in `execution_mode`, starting from index `0` to
modification_count.

Note: The order of the modifications can matter depending on the
modifications. For example, modifications on a spine should operate before
modifications on the arms in order to get proper results.

bool get_is_setup() const

Returns a boolean that indicates whether the modification stack is setup and
can execute.

SkeletonModification2D get_modification(mod_idx: int) const

Returns the SkeletonModification2D at the passed-in index, `mod_idx`.

Skeleton2D get_skeleton() const

Returns the Skeleton2D node that the SkeletonModificationStack2D is bound to.

void set_modification(mod_idx: int, modification: SkeletonModification2D)

Sets the modification at `mod_idx` to the passed-in modification,
`modification`.

void setup()

Sets up the modification stack so it can execute. This function should be
called by Skeleton2D and shouldn't be manually called unless you know what you
are doing.
