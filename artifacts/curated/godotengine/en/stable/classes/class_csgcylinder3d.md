A CSG Cylinder shape.

## Description

This node allows you to create a cylinder (or cone) for use with the CSG
system.

Note: CSG nodes are intended to be used for level prototyping. Creating CSG
nodes has a significant CPU cost compared to creating a MeshInstance3D with a
PrimitiveMesh. Moving a CSG node within another CSG node also has a
significant CPU cost, so it should be avoided during gameplay.

## Properties

bool | cone | `false`  
---|---|---  
float | height | `2.0`  
Material | material  
float | radius | `0.5`  
int | sides | `8`  
bool | smooth_faces | `true`  
  
## Property Descriptions

bool cone = `false`

  * void set_cone(value: bool)

  * bool is_cone()

If `true` a cone is created, the radius will only apply to one side.

float height = `2.0`

  * void set_height(value: float)

  * float get_height()

The height of the cylinder.

Material material

  * void set_material(value: Material)

  * Material get_material()

The material used to render the cylinder.

float radius = `0.5`

  * void set_radius(value: float)

  * float get_radius()

The radius of the cylinder.

int sides = `8`

  * void set_sides(value: int)

  * int get_sides()

The number of sides of the cylinder, the higher this number the more detail
there will be in the cylinder.

bool smooth_faces = `true`

  * void set_smooth_faces(value: bool)

  * bool get_smooth_faces()

If `true` the normals of the cylinder are set to give a smooth effect making
the cylinder seem rounded. If `false` the cylinder will have a flat shaded
look.
