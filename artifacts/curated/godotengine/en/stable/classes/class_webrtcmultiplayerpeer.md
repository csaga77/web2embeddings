# WebRTCMultiplayerPeer

Inherits: MultiplayerPeer < PacketPeer < RefCounted < Object

A simple interface to create a peer-to-peer mesh network composed of
WebRTCPeerConnection that is compatible with the MultiplayerAPI.

## Description

This class constructs a full mesh of WebRTCPeerConnection (one connection for
each peer) that can be used as a MultiplayerAPI.multiplayer_peer.

You can add each WebRTCPeerConnection via add_peer() or remove them via
remove_peer(). Peers must be added in WebRTCPeerConnection.STATE_NEW state to
allow it to create the appropriate channels. This class will not create offers
nor set descriptions, it will only poll them, and notify connections and
disconnections.

When creating the peer via create_client() or create_server() the
MultiplayerPeer.is_server_relay_supported() method will return `true` enabling
peer exchange and packet relaying when supported by the MultiplayerAPI
implementation.

Note: When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the `INTERNET` permission
in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click
deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by
Android.

## Method Descriptions

Error add_peer(peer: WebRTCPeerConnection, peer_id: int, unreliable_lifetime:
int = 1)

Add a new peer to the mesh with the given `peer_id`. The WebRTCPeerConnection
must be in state WebRTCPeerConnection.STATE_NEW.

Three channels will be created for reliable, unreliable, and ordered
transport. The value of `unreliable_lifetime` will be passed to the
`"maxPacketLifetime"` option when creating unreliable and ordered channels
(see WebRTCPeerConnection.create_data_channel()).

Error create_client(peer_id: int, channels_config: Array = [])

Initialize the multiplayer peer as a client with the given `peer_id` (must be
between 2 and 2147483647). In this mode, you should only call add_peer() once
and with `peer_id` of `1`. This mode enables
MultiplayerPeer.is_server_relay_supported(), allowing the upper MultiplayerAPI
layer to perform peer exchange and packet relaying.

You can optionally specify a `channels_config` array of TransferMode which
will be used to create extra channels (WebRTC only supports one transfer mode
per channel).

Error create_mesh(peer_id: int, channels_config: Array = [])

Initialize the multiplayer peer as a mesh (i.e. all peers connect to each
other) with the given `peer_id` (must be between 1 and 2147483647).

Error create_server(channels_config: Array = [])

Initialize the multiplayer peer as a server (with unique ID of `1`). This mode
enables MultiplayerPeer.is_server_relay_supported(), allowing the upper
MultiplayerAPI layer to perform peer exchange and packet relaying.

You can optionally specify a `channels_config` array of TransferMode which
will be used to create extra channels (WebRTC only supports one transfer mode
per channel).

Dictionary get_peer(peer_id: int)

Returns a dictionary representation of the peer with given `peer_id` with
three keys. `"connection"` containing the WebRTCPeerConnection to this peer,
`"channels"` an array of three WebRTCDataChannel, and `"connected"` a boolean
representing if the peer connection is currently connected (all three channels
are open).

Dictionary get_peers()

Returns a dictionary which keys are the peer ids and values the peer
representation as in get_peer().

bool has_peer(peer_id: int)

Returns `true` if the given `peer_id` is in the peers map (it might not be
connected though).

void remove_peer(peer_id: int)

Remove the peer with given `peer_id` from the mesh. If the peer was connected,
and MultiplayerPeer.peer_connected was emitted for it, then
MultiplayerPeer.peer_disconnected will be emitted.
