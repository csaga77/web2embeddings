A box-shaped attractor that influences particles from GPUParticles3D nodes.

## Description

A box-shaped attractor that influences particles from GPUParticles3D nodes.
Can be used to attract particles towards its origin, or to push them away from
its origin.

Particle attractors work in real-time and can be moved, rotated and scaled
during gameplay. Unlike collision shapes, non-uniform scaling of attractors is
also supported.

Note: Particle attractors only affect GPUParticles3D, not CPUParticles3D.
