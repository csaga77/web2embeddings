# CSGShape3D

Inherits: GeometryInstance3D < VisualInstance3D < Node3D < Node < Object

The CSG base class.

## Description

This is the CSG base class that provides CSG operation support to the various
CSG nodes in Godot.

Performance: CSG nodes are only intended for prototyping as they have a
significant CPU performance cost.

Consider baking final CSG operation results into static geometry that replaces
the CSG nodes.

Individual CSG root node results can be baked to nodes with static resources
with the editor menu that appears when a CSG root node is selected.

Individual CSG root nodes can also be baked to static resources with scripts
by calling bake_static_mesh() for the visual mesh or bake_collision_shape()
for the physics collision.

Entire scenes of CSG nodes can be baked to static geometry and exported with
the editor gltf scene exporter.

## Enumerations

enum Operation:

Operation OPERATION_UNION = `0`

Geometry of both primitives is merged, intersecting geometry is removed.

Operation OPERATION_INTERSECTION = `1`

Only intersecting geometry remains, the rest is removed.

Operation OPERATION_SUBTRACTION = `2`

The second shape is subtracted from the first, leaving a dent with its shape.

## Property Descriptions

bool calculate_tangents = `true`

  * void set_calculate_tangents(value: bool)

  * bool is_calculating_tangents()

Calculate tangents for the CSG shape which allows the use of normal maps. This
is only applied on the root shape, this setting is ignored on any child.

int collision_layer = `1`

  * void set_collision_layer(value: int)

  * int get_collision_layer()

The physics layers this area is in.

Collidable objects can exist in any of 32 different layers. These layers work
like a tagging system, and are not visual. A collidable can use these layers
to select with which objects it can collide, using the collision_mask
property.

A contact is detected if object A is in any of the layers that object B scans,
or object B is in any layer scanned by object A. See Collision layers and
masks in the documentation for more information.

int collision_mask = `1`

  * void set_collision_mask(value: int)

  * int get_collision_mask()

The physics layers this CSG shape scans for collisions. Only effective if
use_collision is `true`. See Collision layers and masks in the documentation
for more information.

float collision_priority = `1.0`

  * void set_collision_priority(value: float)

  * float get_collision_priority()

The priority used to solve colliding when occurring penetration. Only
effective if use_collision is `true`. The higher the priority is, the lower
the penetration into the object will be. This can for example be used to
prevent the player from breaking through the boundaries of a level.

Operation operation = `0`

  * void set_operation(value: Operation)

  * Operation get_operation()

The operation that is performed on this shape. This is ignored for the first
CSG child node as the operation is between this node and the previous child of
this nodes parent.

float snap

  * void set_snap(value: float)

  * float get_snap()

Deprecated: The CSG library no longer uses snapping.

This property does nothing.

bool use_collision = `false`

  * void set_use_collision(value: bool)

  * bool is_using_collision()

Adds a collision shape to the physics engine for our CSG shape. This will
always act like a static body. Note that the collision shape is still active
even if the CSG shape itself is hidden. See also collision_mask and
collision_priority.

## Method Descriptions

ConcavePolygonShape3D bake_collision_shape()

Returns a baked physics ConcavePolygonShape3D of this node's CSG operation
result. Returns an empty shape if the node is not a CSG root node or has no
valid geometry.

Performance: If the CSG operation results in a very detailed geometry with
many faces physics performance will be very slow. Concave shapes should in
general only be used for static level geometry and not with dynamic objects
that are moving.

ArrayMesh bake_static_mesh()

Returns a baked static ArrayMesh of this node's CSG operation result.
Materials from involved CSG nodes are added as extra mesh surfaces. Returns an
empty mesh if the node is not a CSG root node or has no valid geometry.

bool get_collision_layer_value(layer_number: int) const

Returns whether or not the specified layer of the collision_layer is enabled,
given a `layer_number` between 1 and 32.

bool get_collision_mask_value(layer_number: int) const

Returns whether or not the specified layer of the collision_mask is enabled,
given a `layer_number` between 1 and 32.

Array get_meshes() const

Returns an Array with two elements, the first is the Transform3D of this node
and the second is the root Mesh of this node. Only works when this node is the
root shape.

bool is_root_shape() const

Returns `true` if this is a root shape and is thus the object that is
rendered.

void set_collision_layer_value(layer_number: int, value: bool)

Based on `value`, enables or disables the specified layer in the
collision_layer, given a `layer_number` between 1 and 32.

void set_collision_mask_value(layer_number: int, value: bool)

Based on `value`, enables or disables the specified layer in the
collision_mask, given a `layer_number` between 1 and 32.
