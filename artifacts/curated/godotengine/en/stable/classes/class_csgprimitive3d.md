Base class for CSG primitives.

## Description

Parent class for various CSG primitives. It contains code and functionality
that is common between them. It cannot be used directly. Instead use one of
the various classes that inherit from it.

Note: CSG nodes are intended to be used for level prototyping. Creating CSG
nodes has a significant CPU cost compared to creating a MeshInstance3D with a
PrimitiveMesh. Moving a CSG node within another CSG node also has a
significant CPU cost, so it should be avoided during gameplay.

## Properties

bool | flip_faces | `false`  
---|---|---  
  
## Property Descriptions

bool flip_faces = `false`

  * void set_flip_faces(value: bool)

  * bool get_flip_faces()

If set, the order of the vertices in each triangle are reversed resulting in
the backside of the mesh being drawn.
