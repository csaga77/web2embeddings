# GLTFBufferView

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

Represents a glTF buffer view.

## Description

GLTFBufferView is a data structure representing a glTF `bufferView` that would
be found in the `"bufferViews"` array. A buffer is a blob of binary data. A
buffer view is a slice of a buffer that can be used to identify and extract
data from the buffer.

Most custom uses of buffers only need to use the buffer, byte_length, and
byte_offset. The byte_stride and indices properties are for more advanced use
cases such as interleaved mesh data encoded for the GPU.

## Properties

int | buffer | `-1`  
---|---|---  
int | byte_length | `0`  
int | byte_offset | `0`  
int | byte_stride | `-1`  
bool | indices | `false`  
bool | vertex_attributes | `false`  
  
## Methods

## Property Descriptions

int buffer = `-1`

  * void set_buffer(value: int)

  * int get_buffer()

The index of the buffer this buffer view is referencing. If `-1`, this buffer
view is not referencing any buffer.

int byte_length = `0`

  * void set_byte_length(value: int)

  * int get_byte_length()

The length, in bytes, of this buffer view. If `0`, this buffer view is empty.

int byte_offset = `0`

  * void set_byte_offset(value: int)

  * int get_byte_offset()

The offset, in bytes, from the start of the buffer to the start of this buffer
view.

int byte_stride = `-1`

  * void set_byte_stride(value: int)

  * int get_byte_stride()

The stride, in bytes, between interleaved data. If `-1`, this buffer view is
not interleaved.

bool indices = `false`

  * void set_indices(value: bool)

  * bool get_indices()

`true` if the GLTFBufferView's OpenGL GPU buffer type is an
`ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER` used for vertex indices (integer constant `34963`).
`false` if the buffer type is any other value. See Buffers, BufferViews, and
Accessors for possible values. This property is set on import and used on
export.

bool vertex_attributes = `false`

  * void set_vertex_attributes(value: bool)

  * bool get_vertex_attributes()

`true` if the GLTFBufferView's OpenGL GPU buffer type is an `ARRAY_BUFFER`
used for vertex attributes (integer constant `34962`). `false` if the buffer
type is any other value. See Buffers, BufferViews, and Accessors for possible
values. This property is set on import and used on export.

## Method Descriptions

PackedByteArray load_buffer_view_data(state: GLTFState) const

Loads the buffer view data from the buffer referenced by this buffer view in
the given GLTFState. Interleaved data with a byte stride is not yet supported
by this method. The data is returned as a PackedByteArray.
