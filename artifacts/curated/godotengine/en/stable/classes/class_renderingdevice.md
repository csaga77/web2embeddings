# RenderingDevice

Inherits: Object

Abstraction for working with modern low-level graphics APIs.

## Description

RenderingDevice is an abstraction for working with modern low-level graphics
APIs such as Vulkan. Compared to RenderingServer (which works with Godot's own
rendering subsystems), RenderingDevice is much lower-level and allows working
more directly with the underlying graphics APIs. RenderingDevice is used in
Godot to provide support for several modern low-level graphics APIs while
reducing the amount of code duplication required. RenderingDevice can also be
used in your own projects to perform things that are not exposed by
RenderingServer or high-level nodes, such as using compute shaders.

On startup, Godot creates a global RenderingDevice which can be retrieved
using RenderingServer.get_rendering_device(). This global RenderingDevice
performs drawing to the screen.

Local RenderingDevices: Using RenderingServer.create_local_rendering_device(),
you can create "secondary" rendering devices to perform drawing and GPU
compute operations on separate threads.

Note: RenderingDevice assumes intermediate knowledge of modern graphics APIs
such as Vulkan, Direct3D 12, Metal or WebGPU. These graphics APIs are lower-
level than OpenGL or Direct3D 11, requiring you to perform what was previously
done by the graphics driver itself. If you have difficulty understanding the
concepts used in this class, follow the Vulkan Tutorial or Vulkan Guide. It's
recommended to have existing modern OpenGL or Direct3D 11 knowledge before
attempting to learn a low-level graphics API.

Note: RenderingDevice is not available when running in headless mode or when
using the Compatibility rendering method.

## Enumerations

enum DeviceType:

DeviceType DEVICE_TYPE_OTHER = `0`

Rendering device type does not match any of the other enum values or is
unknown.

DeviceType DEVICE_TYPE_INTEGRATED_GPU = `1`

Rendering device is an integrated GPU, which is typically (but not always)
slower than dedicated GPUs (DEVICE_TYPE_DISCRETE_GPU). On Android and iOS, the
rendering device type is always considered to be DEVICE_TYPE_INTEGRATED_GPU.

DeviceType DEVICE_TYPE_DISCRETE_GPU = `2`

Rendering device is a dedicated GPU, which is typically (but not always)
faster than integrated GPUs (DEVICE_TYPE_INTEGRATED_GPU).

DeviceType DEVICE_TYPE_VIRTUAL_GPU = `3`

Rendering device is an emulated GPU in a virtual environment. This is
typically much slower than the host GPU, which means the expected performance
level on a dedicated GPU will be roughly equivalent to
DEVICE_TYPE_INTEGRATED_GPU. Virtual machine GPU passthrough (such as VFIO)
will not report the device type as DEVICE_TYPE_VIRTUAL_GPU. Instead, the host
GPU's device type will be reported as if the GPU was not emulated.

DeviceType DEVICE_TYPE_CPU = `4`

Rendering device is provided by software emulation (such as Lavapipe or
SwiftShader). This is the slowest kind of rendering device available; it's
typically much slower than DEVICE_TYPE_INTEGRATED_GPU.

## Method Descriptions

void barrier(from: BitField[BarrierMask] = 32767, to: BitField[BarrierMask] =
32767)

Deprecated: Barriers are automatically inserted by RenderingDevice.

This method does nothing.

Error buffer_clear(buffer: RID, offset: int, size_bytes: int)

Clears the contents of the `buffer`, clearing `size_bytes` bytes, starting at
`offset`.

Prints an error if:

  * the size isn't a multiple of four

  * the region specified by `offset` \+ `size_bytes` exceeds the buffer

  * a draw list is currently active (created by draw_list_begin())

  * a compute list is currently active (created by compute_list_begin())

Error buffer_copy(src_buffer: RID, dst_buffer: RID, src_offset: int,
dst_offset: int, size: int)

Copies `size` bytes from the `src_buffer` at `src_offset` into `dst_buffer` at
`dst_offset`.

Prints an error if:

  * `size` exceeds the size of either `src_buffer` or `dst_buffer` at their corresponding offsets

  * a draw list is currently active (created by draw_list_begin())

  * a compute list is currently active (created by compute_list_begin())

PackedByteArray buffer_get_data(buffer: RID, offset_bytes: int = 0,
size_bytes: int = 0)

Returns a copy of the data of the specified `buffer`, optionally
`offset_bytes` and `size_bytes` can be set to copy only a portion of the
buffer.

Note: This method will block the GPU from working until the data is retrieved.
Refer to buffer_get_data_async() for an alternative that returns the data in
more performant way.

Error buffer_get_data_async(buffer: RID, callback: Callable, offset_bytes: int
= 0, size_bytes: int = 0)

Asynchronous version of buffer_get_data(). RenderingDevice will call
`callback` in a certain amount of frames with the data the buffer had at the
time of the request.

Note: At the moment, the delay corresponds to the amount of frames specified
by ProjectSettings.rendering/rendering_device/vsync/frame_queue_size.

Note: Downloading large buffers can have a prohibitive cost for real-time even
when using the asynchronous method due to hardware bandwidth limitations. When
dealing with large resources, you can adjust settings such as
ProjectSettings.rendering/rendering_device/staging_buffer/block_size_kb to
improve the transfer speed at the cost of extra memory.

    
    
    func _buffer_get_data_callback(array):
        value = array.decode_u32(0)
    
    ...
    
    rd.buffer_get_data_async(buffer, _buffer_get_data_callback)
    

int buffer_get_device_address(buffer: RID)

Returns the address of the given `buffer` which can be passed to shaders in
any way to access underlying data. Buffer must have been created with this
feature enabled.

Note: You must check that the GPU supports this functionality by calling
has_feature() with SUPPORTS_BUFFER_DEVICE_ADDRESS as a parameter.

Error buffer_update(buffer: RID, offset: int, size_bytes: int, data:
PackedByteArray)

Updates a region of `size_bytes` bytes, starting at `offset`, in the buffer,
with the specified `data`.

Prints an error if:

  * the region specified by `offset` \+ `size_bytes` exceeds the buffer

  * a draw list is currently active (created by draw_list_begin())

  * a compute list is currently active (created by compute_list_begin())

void capture_timestamp(name: String)

Creates a timestamp marker with the specified `name`. This is used for
performance reporting with the get_captured_timestamp_cpu_time(),
get_captured_timestamp_gpu_time() and get_captured_timestamp_name() methods.

void compute_list_add_barrier(compute_list: int)

Raises a Vulkan compute barrier in the specified `compute_list`.

int compute_list_begin()

Starts a list of compute commands created with the `compute_*` methods. The
returned value should be passed to other `compute_list_*` functions.

Multiple compute lists cannot be created at the same time; you must finish the
previous compute list first using compute_list_end().

A simple compute operation might look like this (code is not a complete
example):

    
    
    var rd = RenderingDevice.new()
    var compute_list = rd.compute_list_begin()
    
    rd.compute_list_bind_compute_pipeline(compute_list, compute_shader_dilate_pipeline)
    rd.compute_list_bind_uniform_set(compute_list, compute_base_uniform_set, 0)
    rd.compute_list_bind_uniform_set(compute_list, dilate_uniform_set, 1)
    
    for i in atlas_slices:
        rd.compute_list_set_push_constant(compute_list, push_constant, push_constant.size())
        rd.compute_list_dispatch(compute_list, group_size.x, group_size.y, group_size.z)
        # No barrier, let them run all together.
    
    rd.compute_list_end()
    

void compute_list_bind_compute_pipeline(compute_list: int, compute_pipeline:
RID)

Tells the GPU what compute pipeline to use when processing the compute list.
If the shader has changed since the last time this function was called, Godot
will unbind all descriptor sets and will re-bind them inside
compute_list_dispatch().

void compute_list_bind_uniform_set(compute_list: int, uniform_set: RID,
set_index: int)

Binds the `uniform_set` to this `compute_list`. Godot ensures that all
textures in the uniform set have the correct Vulkan access masks. If Godot had
to change access masks of textures, it will raise a Vulkan image memory
barrier.

void compute_list_dispatch(compute_list: int, x_groups: int, y_groups: int,
z_groups: int)

Submits the compute list for processing on the GPU. This is the compute
equivalent to draw_list_draw().

void compute_list_dispatch_indirect(compute_list: int, buffer: RID, offset:
int)

Submits the compute list for processing on the GPU with the given group counts
stored in the `buffer` at `offset`. Buffer must have been created with
STORAGE_BUFFER_USAGE_DISPATCH_INDIRECT flag.

void compute_list_end()

Finishes a list of compute commands created with the `compute_*` methods.

void compute_list_set_push_constant(compute_list: int, buffer:
PackedByteArray, size_bytes: int)

Sets the push constant data to `buffer` for the specified `compute_list`. The
shader determines how this binary data is used. The buffer's size in bytes
must also be specified in `size_bytes` (this can be obtained by calling the
PackedByteArray.size() method on the passed `buffer`).

RID compute_pipeline_create(shader: RID, specialization_constants:
Array[RDPipelineSpecializationConstant] = [])

Creates a new compute pipeline. It can be accessed with the RID that is
returned.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingDevice's free_rid() method.

bool compute_pipeline_is_valid(compute_pipeline: RID)

Returns `true` if the compute pipeline specified by the `compute_pipeline` RID
is valid, `false` otherwise.

RenderingDevice create_local_device()

Create a new local RenderingDevice. This is most useful for performing compute
operations on the GPU independently from the rest of the engine.

void draw_command_begin_label(name: String, color: Color)

Create a command buffer debug label region that can be displayed in third-
party tools such as RenderDoc. All regions must be ended with a
draw_command_end_label() call. When viewed from the linear series of
submissions to a single queue, calls to draw_command_begin_label() and
draw_command_end_label() must be matched and balanced.

The `VK_EXT_DEBUG_UTILS_EXTENSION_NAME` Vulkan extension must be available and
enabled for command buffer debug label region to work. See also
draw_command_end_label().

void draw_command_end_label()

Ends the command buffer debug label region started by a
draw_command_begin_label() call.

void draw_command_insert_label(name: String, color: Color)

Deprecated: Inserting labels no longer applies due to command reordering.

This method does nothing.

int draw_list_begin(framebuffer: RID, draw_flags: BitField[DrawFlags] = 0,
clear_color_values: PackedColorArray = PackedColorArray(), clear_depth_value:
float = 1.0, clear_stencil_value: int = 0, region: Rect2 = Rect2(0, 0, 0, 0),
breadcrumb: int = 0)

Starts a list of raster drawing commands created with the `draw_*` methods.
The returned value should be passed to other `draw_list_*` functions.

Multiple draw lists cannot be created at the same time; you must finish the
previous draw list first using draw_list_end().

A simple drawing operation might look like this (code is not a complete
example):

    
    
    var rd = RenderingDevice.new()
    var clear_colors = PackedColorArray([Color(0, 0, 0, 0), Color(0, 0, 0, 0), Color(0, 0, 0, 0)])
    var draw_list = rd.draw_list_begin(framebuffers[i], RenderingDevice.CLEAR_COLOR_ALL, clear_colors, true, 1.0f, true, 0, Rect2(), RenderingDevice.OPAQUE_PASS)
    
    # Draw opaque.
    rd.draw_list_bind_render_pipeline(draw_list, raster_pipeline)
    rd.draw_list_bind_uniform_set(draw_list, raster_base_uniform, 0)
    rd.draw_list_set_push_constant(draw_list, raster_push_constant, raster_push_constant.size())
    rd.draw_list_draw(draw_list, false, 1, slice_triangle_count[i] * 3)
    # Draw wire.
    rd.draw_list_bind_render_pipeline(draw_list, raster_pipeline_wire)
    rd.draw_list_bind_uniform_set(draw_list, raster_base_uniform, 0)
    rd.draw_list_set_push_constant(draw_list, raster_push_constant, raster_push_constant.size())
    rd.draw_list_draw(draw_list, false, 1, slice_triangle_count[i] * 3)
    
    rd.draw_list_end()
    

The `draw_flags` indicates if the texture attachments of the framebuffer
should be cleared or ignored. Only one of the two flags can be used for each
individual attachment. Ignoring an attachment means that any contents that
existed before the draw list will be completely discarded, reducing the memory
bandwidth used by the render pass but producing garbage results if the pixels
aren't replaced. The default behavior allows the engine to figure out the
right operation to use if the texture is discardable, which can result in
increased performance. See RDTextureFormat or texture_set_discardable().

The `breadcrumb` parameter can be an arbitrary 32-bit integer that is useful
to diagnose GPU crashes. If Godot is built in dev or debug mode; when the GPU
crashes Godot will dump all shaders that were being executed at the time of
the crash and the breadcrumb is useful to diagnose what passes did those
shaders belong to.

It does not affect rendering behavior and can be set to 0. It is recommended
to use BreadcrumbMarker enumerations for consistency but it's not required. It
is also possible to use bitwise operations to add extra data. e.g.

    
    
    rd.draw_list_begin(fb[i], RenderingDevice.CLEAR_COLOR_ALL, clear_colors, true, 1.0f, true, 0, Rect2(), RenderingDevice.OPAQUE_PASS | 5)
    

int draw_list_begin_for_screen(screen: int = 0, clear_color: Color = Color(0,
0, 0, 1))

High-level variant of draw_list_begin(), with the parameters automatically
being adjusted for drawing onto the window specified by the `screen` ID.

Note: Cannot be used with local RenderingDevices, as these don't have a
screen. If called on a local RenderingDevice, draw_list_begin_for_screen()
returns INVALID_ID.

PackedInt64Array draw_list_begin_split(framebuffer: RID, splits: int,
initial_color_action: InitialAction, final_color_action: FinalAction,
initial_depth_action: InitialAction, final_depth_action: FinalAction,
clear_color_values: PackedColorArray = PackedColorArray(), clear_depth: float
= 1.0, clear_stencil: int = 0, region: Rect2 = Rect2(0, 0, 0, 0),
storage_textures: Array[RID] = [])

Deprecated: Split draw lists are used automatically by RenderingDevice.

This method does nothing and always returns an empty PackedInt64Array.

also draw_list_enable_scissor().

void draw_list_draw(draw_list: int, use_indices: bool, instances: int,
procedural_vertex_count: int = 0)

Submits `draw_list` for rendering on the GPU. This is the raster equivalent to
compute_list_dispatch().

void draw_list_draw_indirect(draw_list: int, use_indices: bool, buffer: RID,
offset: int = 0, draw_count: int = 1, stride: int = 0)

Submits `draw_list` for rendering on the GPU with the given parameters stored
in the `buffer` at `offset`. Parameters being integers: vertex count, instance
count, first vertex, first instance. And when using indices: index count,
instance count, first index, vertex offset, first instance. Buffer must have
been created with STORAGE_BUFFER_USAGE_DISPATCH_INDIRECT flag.

void draw_list_enable_scissor(draw_list: int, rect: Rect2 = Rect2(0, 0, 0, 0))

Creates a scissor rectangle and enables it for the specified `draw_list`.
Scissor rectangles are used for clipping by discarding fragments that fall
outside a specified rectangular portion of the screen. See also
draw_list_disable_scissor().

Note: The specified `rect` is automatically intersected with the screen's
dimensions, which means it cannot exceed the screen's dimensions.

void draw_list_end()

Finishes a list of raster drawing commands created with the `draw_*` methods.

void draw_list_set_blend_constants(draw_list: int, color: Color)

Sets blend constants for the specified `draw_list` to `color`. Blend constants
are used only if the graphics pipeline is created with
DYNAMIC_STATE_BLEND_CONSTANTS flag set.

void draw_list_set_push_constant(draw_list: int, buffer: PackedByteArray,
size_bytes: int)

Sets the push constant data to `buffer` for the specified `draw_list`. The
shader determines how this binary data is used. The buffer's size in bytes
must also be specified in `size_bytes` (this can be obtained by calling the
PackedByteArray.size() method on the passed `buffer`).

int draw_list_switch_to_next_pass()

Switches to the next draw pass.

PackedInt64Array draw_list_switch_to_next_pass_split(splits: int)

Deprecated: Split draw lists are used automatically by RenderingDevice.

This method does nothing and always returns an empty PackedInt64Array.

RID framebuffer_create(textures: Array[RID], validate_with_format: int = -1,
view_count: int = 1)

Creates a new framebuffer. It can be accessed with the RID that is returned.

validate_with_format: int = -1)

Creates a new empty framebuffer. It can be accessed with the RID that is
returned.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingDevice's free_rid() method.

RID framebuffer_create_multipass(textures: Array[RID], passes:
Array[RDFramebufferPass], validate_with_format: int = -1, view_count: int = 1)

used for VR rendering. This requires support for the Vulkan multiview
extension.

int framebuffer_format_create_empty(samples: TextureSamples = 0)

Creates a new empty framebuffer format with the specified number of `samples`
and returns its ID.

int framebuffer_format_create_multipass(attachments:
Array[RDAttachmentFormat], passes: Array[RDFramebufferPass], view_count: int =
1)

Creates a multipass framebuffer format with the specified `attachments`,
`passes` and `view_count` and returns its ID. If `view_count` is greater than

requires support for the Vulkan multiview extension.

TextureSamples framebuffer_format_get_texture_samples(format: int,
render_pass: int = 0)

Returns the number of texture samples used for the given framebuffer `format`
ID (returned by framebuffer_get_format()).

int framebuffer_get_format(framebuffer: RID)

Same as get_driver_total_memory() but filtered for a given object type.

The type argument must be in range `[0; get_tracked_object_type_count - 1]`.
If get_tracked_object_type_count() is 0, then type argument is ignored and
always returns 0.

This is only used by Vulkan in debug builds and can return 0 when this
information is not tracked or unknown.

int get_driver_resource(resource: DriverResource, rid: RID, index: int)

Returns the unique identifier of the driver `resource` for the specified
`rid`. Some driver resource types ignore the specified `rid` (see
DriverResource descriptions). `index` is always ignored but must be specified
anyway.

int get_driver_total_memory() const

Returns how much bytes the GPU driver is using for internal driver structures.

This is only used by Vulkan in debug builds and can return 0 when this
information is not tracked or unknown.

int get_frame_delay() const

Returns the frame count kept by the graphics API. Higher values result in
higher input lag, but with more consistent throughput. For the main
RenderingDevice, frames are cycled (usually 3 with triple-buffered V-Sync
enabled). However, local RenderingDevices only have 1 frame.

int get_memory_usage(type: MemoryType) const

Returns the memory usage in bytes corresponding to the given `type`. When
using Vulkan, these statistics are calculated by Vulkan Memory Allocator.

String get_perf_report() const

Returns a string with a performance report from the past frame. Updates every
frame.

String get_tracked_object_name(type_index: int) const

Returns the name of the type of object for the given `type_index`. This value
must be in range `[0; get_tracked_object_type_count - 1]`. If
get_tracked_object_type_count() is 0, then type argument is ignored and always
returns the same string.

The return value is important because it gives meaning to the types passed to
get_driver_memory_by_object_type(), get_driver_allocs_by_object_type(),
get_device_memory_by_object_type(), and get_device_allocs_by_object_type().
Examples of strings it can return (not exhaustive):

  * DEVICE_MEMORY

  * PIPELINE_CACHE

  * SWAPCHAIN_KHR

  * COMMAND_POOL

Thus if e.g. `get_tracked_object_name(5)` returns "COMMAND_POOL", then
`get_device_memory_by_object_type(5)` returns the bytes used by the GPU for
command pools.

This is only used by Vulkan in debug builds. Godot must also be started with
the `--extra-gpu-memory-tracking` command line argument.

int get_tracked_object_type_count() const

Returns how many types of trackable objects are.

This is only used by Vulkan in debug builds. Godot must also be started with
the `--extra-gpu-memory-tracking` command line argument.

bool has_feature(feature: Features) const

Returns `true` if the `feature` is supported by the GPU.

RID index_array_create(index_buffer: RID, index_offset: int, index_count: int)

Creates a new index array. It can be accessed with the RID that is returned.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingDevice's free_rid() method.

RID index_buffer_create(size_indices: int, format: IndexBufferFormat, data:
PackedByteArray = PackedByteArray(), use_restart_indices: bool = false,
creation_bits: BitField[BufferCreationBits] = 0)

Creates a new index buffer. It can be accessed with the RID that is returned.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingDevice's free_rid() method.

int limit_get(limit: Limit) const

Returns the value of the specified `limit`. This limit varies depending on the
current graphics hardware (and sometimes the driver version). If the given
limit is exceeded, rendering errors will occur.

Limits for various graphics hardware can be found in the Vulkan Hardware
Database.

RID render_pipeline_create(shader: RID, framebuffer_format: int,
vertex_format: int, primitive: RenderPrimitive, rasterization_state:
RDPipelineRasterizationState, multisample_state: RDPipelineMultisampleState,
stencil_state: RDPipelineDepthStencilState, color_blend_state:
RDPipelineColorBlendState, dynamic_state_flags:
BitField[PipelineDynamicStateFlags] = 0, for_render_pass: int = 0,
specialization_constants: Array[RDPipelineSpecializationConstant] = [])

Creates a new render pipeline. It can be accessed with the RID that is
returned.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingDevice's free_rid() method.

bool render_pipeline_is_valid(render_pipeline: RID)

Returns `true` if the render pipeline specified by the `render_pipeline` RID
is valid, `false` otherwise.

RID sampler_create(state: RDSamplerState)

Creates a new sampler. It can be accessed with the RID that is returned.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingDevice's free_rid() method.

bool sampler_is_format_supported_for_filter(format: DataFormat,
sampler_filter: SamplerFilter) const

Returns `true` if implementation supports using a texture of `format` with the
given `sampler_filter`.

int screen_get_framebuffer_format(screen: int = 0) const

Returns the framebuffer format of the given screen.

Note: Only the main RenderingDevice returned by
RenderingServer.get_rendering_device() has a format. If called on a local
RenderingDevice, this method prints an error and returns INVALID_ID.

int screen_get_height(screen: int = 0) const

Returns the window height matching the graphics API context for the given
window ID (in pixels). Despite the parameter being named `screen`, this
returns the window size. See also screen_get_width().

Note: Only the main RenderingDevice returned by
RenderingServer.get_rendering_device() has a height. If called on a local
RenderingDevice, this method prints an error and returns INVALID_ID.

int screen_get_width(screen: int = 0) const

Returns the window width matching the graphics API context for the given
window ID (in pixels). Despite the parameter being named `screen`, this
returns the window size. See also screen_get_height().

Note: Only the main RenderingDevice returned by
RenderingServer.get_rendering_device() has a width. If called on a local
RenderingDevice, this method prints an error and returns INVALID_ID.

void set_resource_name(id: RID, name: String)

Sets the resource name for `id` to `name`. This is used for debugging with
third-party tools such as RenderDoc.

The following types of resources can be named: texture, sampler, vertex
buffer, index buffer, uniform buffer, texture buffer, storage buffer, uniform
set buffer, shader, render pipeline and compute pipeline. Framebuffers cannot
be named. Attempting to name an incompatible resource type will print an
error.

Note: Resource names are only set when the engine runs in verbose mode
(OS.is_stdout_verbose() = `true`), or when using an engine build compiled with
the `dev_mode=yes` SCons option. The graphics driver must also support the
`VK_EXT_DEBUG_UTILS_EXTENSION_NAME` Vulkan extension for named resources to
work.

PackedByteArray shader_compile_binary_from_spirv(spirv_data: RDShaderSPIRV,
name: String = "")

Compiles a binary shader from `spirv_data` and returns the compiled binary
data as a PackedByteArray. This compiled shader is specific to the GPU model
and driver version used; it will not work on different GPU models or even
different driver versions. See also shader_compile_spirv_from_source().

`name` is an optional human-readable name that can be given to the compiled
shader for organizational purposes.

RDShaderSPIRV shader_compile_spirv_from_source(shader_source: RDShaderSource,
allow_cache: bool = true)

Compiles a SPIR-V from the shader source code in `shader_source` and returns
the SPIR-V as a RDShaderSPIRV. This intermediate language shader is portable
across different GPU models and driver versions, but cannot be run directly by
GPUs until compiled into a binary shader using
shader_compile_binary_from_spirv().

If `allow_cache` is `true`, make use of the shader cache generated by Godot.
This avoids a potentially lengthy shader compilation step if the shader is
already in cache. If `allow_cache` is `false`, Godot's shader cache is ignored
and the shader will always be recompiled.

RID shader_create_from_bytecode(binary_data: PackedByteArray, placeholder_rid:
RID = RID())

Creates a new shader instance from a binary compiled shader. It can be
accessed with the RID that is returned.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingDevice's free_rid() method. See also
shader_compile_binary_from_spirv() and shader_create_from_spirv().

RID shader_create_from_spirv(spirv_data: RDShaderSPIRV, name: String = "")

Creates a new shader instance from SPIR-V intermediate code. It can be
accessed with the RID that is returned.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingDevice's free_rid() method. See also
shader_compile_spirv_from_source() and shader_create_from_bytecode().

RID shader_create_placeholder()

Create a placeholder RID by allocating an RID without initializing it for use
in shader_create_from_bytecode(). This allows you to create an RID for a
shader and pass it around, but defer compiling the shader to a later time.

int shader_get_vertex_input_attribute_mask(shader: RID)

Returns the internal vertex input mask. Internally, the vertex input mask is
an unsigned integer consisting of the locations (specified in GLSL via.
`layout(location = ...)`) of the input variables (specified in GLSL by the
`in` keyword).

RID storage_buffer_create(size_bytes: int, data: PackedByteArray =
PackedByteArray(), usage: BitField[StorageBufferUsage] = 0, creation_bits:
BitField[BufferCreationBits] = 0)

Creates a storage buffer with the specified `data` and `usage`. It can be
accessed with the RID that is returned.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingDevice's free_rid() method.

void submit()

Pushes the frame setup and draw command buffers then marks the local device as
currently processing (which allows calling sync()).

Note: Only available in local RenderingDevices.

void sync()

Forces a synchronization between the CPU and GPU, which may be required in
certain cases. Only call this when needed, as CPU-GPU synchronization has a
performance cost.

Note: Only available in local RenderingDevices.

Note: sync() can only be called after a submit().

RID texture_buffer_create(size_bytes: int, format: DataFormat, data:
PackedByteArray = PackedByteArray())

Creates a new texture buffer. It can be accessed with the RID that is
returned.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingDevice's free_rid() method.

Error texture_clear(texture: RID, color: Color, base_mipmap: int,
mipmap_count: int, base_layer: int, layer_count: int)

Clears the specified `texture` by replacing all of its pixels with the
specified `color`. `base_mipmap` and `mipmap_count` determine which mipmaps of
the texture are affected by this clear operation, while `base_layer` and
`layer_count` determine which layers of a 3D texture (or texture array) are
affected by this clear operation. For 2D textures (which only have one layer
by design), `base_layer` must be `0` and `layer_count` must be `1`.

Note: `texture` can't be cleared while a draw list that uses it as part of a
framebuffer is being created. Ensure the draw list is finalized (and that the
color/depth texture using it is not set to FINAL_ACTION_CONTINUE) to clear
this texture.

Error texture_copy(from_texture: RID, to_texture: RID, from_pos: Vector3,
to_pos: Vector3, size: Vector3, src_mipmap: int, dst_mipmap: int, src_layer:
int, dst_layer: int)

Copies the `from_texture` to `to_texture` with the specified `from_pos`,
`to_pos` and `size` coordinates. The Z axis of the `from_pos`, `to_pos` and
`size` must be `0` for 2-dimensional textures. Source and destination
mipmaps/layers must also be specified, with these parameters being `0` for
textures without mipmaps or single-layer textures. Returns @GlobalScope.OK if
the texture copy was successful or @GlobalScope.ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER
otherwise.

Note: `from_texture` texture can't be copied while a draw list that uses it as
part of a framebuffer is being created. Ensure the draw list is finalized (and
that the color/depth texture using it is not set to FINAL_ACTION_CONTINUE) to
copy this texture.

Note: `from_texture` texture requires the TEXTURE_USAGE_CAN_COPY_FROM_BIT to
be retrieved.

Note: `to_texture` can't be copied while a draw list that uses it as part of a
framebuffer is being created. Ensure the draw list is finalized (and that the
color/depth texture using it is not set to FINAL_ACTION_CONTINUE) to copy this
texture.

Note: `to_texture` requires the TEXTURE_USAGE_CAN_COPY_TO_BIT to be retrieved.

Note: `from_texture` and `to_texture` must be of the same type (color or
depth).

RID texture_create(format: RDTextureFormat, view: RDTextureView, data:
Array[PackedByteArray] = [])

Creates a new texture. It can be accessed with the RID that is returned.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingDevice's free_rid() method.

Note: Not to be confused with RenderingServer.texture_2d_create(), which
creates the Godot-specific Texture2D resource as opposed to the graphics API's
own texture type.

RID texture_create_from_extension(type: TextureType, format: DataFormat,
samples: TextureSamples, usage_flags: BitField[TextureUsageBits], image: int,
width: int, height: int, depth: int, layers: int)

Returns an RID for an existing `image` (`VkImage`) with the given `type`,
`format`, `samples`, `usage_flags`, `width`, `height`, `depth`, and `layers`.
This can be used to allow Godot to render onto foreign images.

RID texture_create_shared(view: RDTextureView, with_texture: RID)

Creates a shared texture using the specified `view` and the texture
information from `with_texture`.

RID texture_create_shared_from_slice(view: RDTextureView, with_texture: RID,
layer: int, mipmap: int, mipmaps: int = 1, slice_type: TextureSliceType = 0)

Creates a shared texture using the specified `view` and the texture
information from `with_texture`'s `layer` and `mipmap`. The number of included
mipmaps from the original texture can be controlled using the `mipmaps`
parameter. Only relevant for textures with multiple layers, such as 3D
textures, texture arrays and cubemaps. For single-layer textures, use
texture_create_shared().

For 2D textures (which only have one layer), `layer` must be `0`.

Note: Layer slicing is only supported for 2D texture arrays, not 3D textures
or cubemaps.

PackedByteArray texture_get_data(texture: RID, layer: int)

Returns the `texture` data for the specified `layer` as raw binary data. For
2D textures (which only have one layer), `layer` must be `0`.

Note: `texture` can't be retrieved while a draw list that uses it as part of a
framebuffer is being created. Ensure the draw list is finalized (and that the
color/depth texture using it is not set to FINAL_ACTION_CONTINUE) to retrieve
this texture. Otherwise, an error is printed and a empty PackedByteArray is
returned.

Note: `texture` requires the TEXTURE_USAGE_CAN_COPY_FROM_BIT to be retrieved.
Otherwise, an error is printed and a empty PackedByteArray is returned.

Note: This method will block the GPU from working until the data is retrieved.
Refer to texture_get_data_async() for an alternative that returns the data in
more performant way.

Error texture_get_data_async(texture: RID, layer: int, callback: Callable)

Asynchronous version of texture_get_data(). RenderingDevice will call
`callback` in a certain amount of frames with the data the texture had at the
time of the request.

Note: At the moment, the delay corresponds to the amount of frames specified
by ProjectSettings.rendering/rendering_device/vsync/frame_queue_size.

Note: Downloading large textures can have a prohibitive cost for real-time
even when using the asynchronous method due to hardware bandwidth limitations.
When dealing with large resources, you can adjust settings such as
ProjectSettings.rendering/rendering_device/staging_buffer/texture_download_region_size_px
and ProjectSettings.rendering/rendering_device/staging_buffer/block_size_kb to
improve the transfer speed at the cost of extra memory.

    
    
    func _texture_get_data_callback(array):
        value = array.decode_u32(0)
    
    ...
    
    rd.texture_get_data_async(texture, 0, _texture_get_data_callback)
    

RDTextureFormat texture_get_format(texture: RID)

Returns the data format used to create this texture.

int texture_get_native_handle(texture: RID)

Deprecated: Use get_driver_resource() with DRIVER_RESOURCE_TEXTURE instead.

Returns the internal graphics handle for this texture object. For use when
communicating with third-party APIs mostly with GDExtension.

Note: This function returns a `uint64_t` which internally maps to a `GLuint`
(OpenGL) or `VkImage` (Vulkan).

bool texture_is_discardable(texture: RID)

Returns `true` if the `texture` is discardable, `false` otherwise. See
RDTextureFormat or texture_set_discardable().

bool texture_is_format_supported_for_usage(format: DataFormat, usage_flags:
BitField[TextureUsageBits]) const

Returns `true` if the specified `format` is supported for the given
`usage_flags`, `false` otherwise.

bool texture_is_shared(texture: RID)

Returns `true` if the `texture` is shared, `false` otherwise. See
RDTextureView.

bool texture_is_valid(texture: RID)

Returns `true` if the `texture` is valid, `false` otherwise.

Error texture_resolve_multisample(from_texture: RID, to_texture: RID)

Resolves the `from_texture` texture onto `to_texture` with multisample
antialiasing enabled. This must be used when rendering a framebuffer for MSAA
to work. Returns @GlobalScope.OK if successful,
@GlobalScope.ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER otherwise.

Note: `from_texture` and `to_texture` textures must have the same dimension,
format and type (color or depth).

Note: `from_texture` can't be copied while a draw list that uses it as part of
a framebuffer is being created. Ensure the draw list is finalized (and that
the color/depth texture using it is not set to FINAL_ACTION_CONTINUE) to
resolve this texture.

Note: `from_texture` requires the TEXTURE_USAGE_CAN_COPY_FROM_BIT to be
retrieved.

Note: `from_texture` must be multisampled and must also be 2D (or a slice of a
3D/cubemap texture).

Note: `to_texture` can't be copied while a draw list that uses it as part of a
framebuffer is being created. Ensure the draw list is finalized (and that the
color/depth texture using it is not set to FINAL_ACTION_CONTINUE) to resolve
this texture.

Note: `to_texture` texture requires the TEXTURE_USAGE_CAN_COPY_TO_BIT to be
retrieved.

Note: `to_texture` texture must not be multisampled and must also be 2D (or a
slice of a 3D/cubemap texture).

void texture_set_discardable(texture: RID, discardable: bool)

Updates the discardable property of `texture`.

If a texture is discardable, its contents do not need to be preserved between
frames. This flag is only relevant when the texture is used as target in a
draw list.

This information is used by RenderingDevice to figure out if a texture's
contents can be discarded, eliminating unnecessary writes to memory and
boosting performance.

Error texture_update(texture: RID, layer: int, data: PackedByteArray)

Updates texture data with new data, replacing the previous data in place. The
updated texture data must have the same dimensions and format. For 2D textures
(which only have one layer), `layer` must be `0`. Returns @GlobalScope.OK if
the update was successful, @GlobalScope.ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER otherwise.

Note: Updating textures is forbidden during creation of a draw or compute
list.

Note: The existing `texture` can't be updated while a draw list that uses it
as part of a framebuffer is being created. Ensure the draw list is finalized
(and that the color/depth texture using it is not set to
FINAL_ACTION_CONTINUE) to update this texture.

Note: The existing `texture` requires the TEXTURE_USAGE_CAN_UPDATE_BIT to be
updatable.

RID uniform_buffer_create(size_bytes: int, data: PackedByteArray =
PackedByteArray(), creation_bits: BitField[BufferCreationBits] = 0)

Creates a new uniform buffer. It can be accessed with the RID that is
returned.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingDevice's free_rid() method.

RID uniform_set_create(uniforms: Array[RDUniform], shader: RID, shader_set:
int)

Creates a new uniform set. It can be accessed with the RID that is returned.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingDevice's free_rid() method.

bool uniform_set_is_valid(uniform_set: RID)

Checks if the `uniform_set` is valid, i.e. is owned.

RID vertex_array_create(vertex_count: int, vertex_format: int, src_buffers:
Array[RID], offsets: PackedInt64Array = PackedInt64Array())

Creates a vertex array based on the specified buffers. Optionally, `offsets`
(in bytes) may be defined for each buffer.

RID vertex_buffer_create(size_bytes: int, data: PackedByteArray =
PackedByteArray(), creation_bits: BitField[BufferCreationBits] = 0)

It can be accessed with the RID that is returned.

Once finished with your RID, you will want to free the RID using the
RenderingDevice's free_rid() method.

int vertex_format_create(vertex_descriptions: Array[RDVertexAttribute])

Creates a new vertex format with the specified `vertex_descriptions`. Returns
a unique vertex format ID corresponding to the newly created vertex format.
