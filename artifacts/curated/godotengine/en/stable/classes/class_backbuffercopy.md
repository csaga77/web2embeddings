# BackBufferCopy

Inherits: Node2D < CanvasItem < Node < Object

A node that copies a region of the screen to a buffer for access in shader
code.

## Description

Node for back-buffering the currently-displayed screen. The region defined in
the BackBufferCopy node is buffered with the content of the screen it covers,
or the entire screen according to the copy_mode. It can be accessed in shader
scripts using the screen texture (i.e. a uniform sampler with
`hint_screen_texture`).

Note: Since this node inherits from Node2D (and not Control), anchors and
margins won't apply to child Control-derived nodes. This can be problematic
when resizing the window. To avoid this, add Control-derived nodes as siblings
to the BackBufferCopy node instead of adding them as children.

## Properties

CopyMode | copy_mode | `1`  
---|---|---  
Rect2 | rect | `Rect2(-100, -100, 200, 200)`  
  
## Enumerations

enum CopyMode:

CopyMode COPY_MODE_DISABLED = `0`

Disables the buffering mode. This means the BackBufferCopy node will directly
use the portion of screen it covers.

CopyMode COPY_MODE_RECT = `1`

BackBufferCopy buffers a rectangular region.

CopyMode COPY_MODE_VIEWPORT = `2`

BackBufferCopy buffers the entire screen.

## Property Descriptions

CopyMode copy_mode = `1`

  * void set_copy_mode(value: CopyMode)

  * CopyMode get_copy_mode()

Buffer mode. See CopyMode constants.

Rect2 rect = `Rect2(-100, -100, 200, 200)`

  * void set_rect(value: Rect2)

  * Rect2 get_rect()

The area covered by the BackBufferCopy. Only used if copy_mode is
COPY_MODE_RECT.
