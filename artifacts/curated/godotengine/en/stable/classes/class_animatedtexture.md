# AnimatedTexture

Deprecated: This class does not work properly in current versions and may be
removed in the future. There is currently no equivalent workaround.

Proxy texture for simple frame-based animations.

## Description

AnimatedTexture is a resource format for frame-based animations, where
multiple textures can be chained automatically with a predefined delay for
each frame. Unlike AnimationPlayer or AnimatedSprite2D, it isn't a Node, but
has the advantage of being usable anywhere a Texture2D resource can be used,
e.g. in a TileSet.

The playback of the animation is controlled by the speed_scale property, as
well as each frame's duration (see set_frame_duration()). The animation loops,
i.e. it will restart at frame 0 automatically after playing the last frame.

AnimatedTexture currently requires all frame textures to have the same size,
otherwise the bigger ones will be cropped to match the smallest one.

Note: AnimatedTexture doesn't support using AtlasTextures. Each frame needs to
be a separate Texture2D.

Warning: The current implementation is not efficient for the modern renderers.

## Properties

int | current_frame  
---|---  
int | frames | `1`  
bool | one_shot | `false`  
bool | pause | `false`  
bool | resource_local_to_scene | `false` (overrides Resource)  
float | speed_scale | `1.0`  
  
## Methods

float | get_frame_duration(frame: int) const  
---|---  
Texture2D | get_frame_texture(frame: int) const  
void | set_frame_duration(frame: int, duration: float)  
void | set_frame_texture(frame: int, texture: Texture2D)  
  
## Constants

MAX_FRAMES = `256`

The maximum number of frames supported by AnimatedTexture. If you need more
frames in your animation, use AnimationPlayer or AnimatedSprite2D.

## Property Descriptions

int current_frame

  * void set_current_frame(value: int)

  * int get_current_frame()

Sets the currently visible frame of the texture. Setting this frame while
playing resets the current frame time, so the newly selected frame plays for
its whole configured frame duration.

int frames = `1`

  * void set_frames(value: int)

  * int get_frames()

Number of frames to use in the animation. While you can create the frames
independently with set_frame_texture(), you need to set this value for the
animation to take new frames into account. The maximum number of frames is
MAX_FRAMES.

bool one_shot = `false`

  * void set_one_shot(value: bool)

  * bool get_one_shot()

If `true`, the animation will only play once and will not loop back to the
first frame after reaching the end. Note that reaching the end will not set
pause to `true`.

bool pause = `false`

  * void set_pause(value: bool)

  * bool get_pause()

If `true`, the animation will pause where it currently is (i.e. at
current_frame). The animation will continue from where it was paused when
changing this property to `false`.

float speed_scale = `1.0`

  * void set_speed_scale(value: float)

  * float get_speed_scale()

The animation speed is multiplied by this value. If set to a negative value,
the animation is played in reverse.

## Method Descriptions

float get_frame_duration(frame: int) const

Returns the given `frame`'s duration, in seconds.

Texture2D get_frame_texture(frame: int) const

Returns the given frame's Texture2D.

void set_frame_duration(frame: int, duration: float)

Sets the duration of any given `frame`. The final duration is affected by the
speed_scale. If set to `0`, the frame is skipped during playback.

void set_frame_texture(frame: int, texture: Texture2D)

Assigns a Texture2D to the given frame. Frame IDs start at 0, so the first
frame has ID 0, and the last frame of the animation has ID frames \- 1.

You can define any number of textures up to MAX_FRAMES, but keep in mind that
only frames from 0 to frames \- 1 will be part of the animation.
