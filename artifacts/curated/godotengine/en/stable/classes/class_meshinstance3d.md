Node that instances meshes into a scenario.

## Description

MeshInstance3D is a node that takes a Mesh resource and adds it to the current
scenario by creating an instance of it. This is the class most often used
render 3D geometry and can be used to instance a single Mesh in many places.
This allows reusing geometry, which can save on resources. When a Mesh has to
be instantiated more than thousands of times at close proximity, consider
using a MultiMesh in a MultiMeshInstance3D instead.

## Method Descriptions

ArrayMesh bake_mesh_from_current_blend_shape_mix(existing: ArrayMesh = null)

Takes a snapshot from the current ArrayMesh with all blend shapes applied
according to their current weights and bakes it to the provided `existing`
mesh. If no `existing` mesh is provided a new ArrayMesh is created, baked and
returned. Mesh surface materials are not copied.

Performance: Mesh data needs to be received from the GPU, stalling the
RenderingServer in the process.

ArrayMesh bake_mesh_from_current_skeleton_pose(existing: ArrayMesh = null)

Takes a snapshot of the current animated skeleton pose of the skinned mesh and
bakes it to the provided `existing` mesh. If no `existing` mesh is provided a
new ArrayMesh is created, baked, and returned. Requires a skeleton with a
registered skin to work. Blendshapes are ignored. Mesh surface materials are
not copied.

Performance: Mesh data needs to be retrieved from the GPU, stalling the
RenderingServer in the process.

void create_convex_collision(clean: bool = true, simplify: bool = false)

This helper creates a StaticBody3D child node with a ConvexPolygonShape3D
collision shape calculated from the mesh geometry. It's mainly used for
testing.

If `clean` is `true` (default), duplicate and interior vertices are removed
automatically. You can set it to `false` to make the process faster if not
needed.

If `simplify` is `true`, the geometry can be further simplified to reduce the
number of vertices. Disabled by default.

void create_debug_tangents()

This helper creates a MeshInstance3D child node with gizmos at every vertex
calculated from the mesh geometry. It's mainly used for testing.

void create_multiple_convex_collisions(settings:
MeshConvexDecompositionSettings = null)

This helper creates a StaticBody3D child node with multiple
ConvexPolygonShape3D collision shapes calculated from the mesh geometry via
convex decomposition. The convex decomposition operation can be controlled
with parameters from the optional `settings`.

void create_trimesh_collision()

This helper creates a StaticBody3D child node with a ConcavePolygonShape3D
collision shape calculated from the mesh geometry. It's mainly used for
testing.

int find_blend_shape_by_name(name: StringName)

Returns the index of the blend shape with the given `name`. Returns `-1` if no
blend shape with this name exists, including when mesh is `null`.

Material get_active_material(surface: int) const

Returns the Material that will be used by the Mesh when drawing. This can
return the GeometryInstance3D.material_override, the surface override Material
defined in this MeshInstance3D, or the surface Material defined in the mesh.
For example, if GeometryInstance3D.material_override is used, all surfaces
will return the override material.

Returns `null` if no material is active, including when mesh is `null`.

int get_blend_shape_count() const

Returns the number of blend shapes available. Produces an error if mesh is
`null`.

float get_blend_shape_value(blend_shape_idx: int) const

Returns the value of the blend shape at the given `blend_shape_idx`. Returns
`0.0` and produces an error if mesh is `null` or doesn't have a blend shape at
that index.

SkinReference get_skin_reference() const

Returns the internal SkinReference containing the skeleton's RID attached to
this RID. See also Resource.get_rid(), SkinReference.get_skeleton(), and
RenderingServer.instance_attach_skeleton().

Material get_surface_override_material(surface: int) const

Returns the override Material for the specified `surface` of the Mesh
resource. See also get_surface_override_material_count().

Note: This returns the Material associated to the MeshInstance3D's Surface
Material Override properties, not the material within the Mesh resource. To
get the material within the Mesh resource, use Mesh.surface_get_material()
instead.

int get_surface_override_material_count() const

Returns the number of surface override materials. This is equivalent to
Mesh.get_surface_count(). See also get_surface_override_material().

void set_blend_shape_value(blend_shape_idx: int, value: float)

Sets the value of the blend shape at `blend_shape_idx` to `value`. Produces an
error if mesh is `null` or doesn't have a blend shape at that index.

void set_surface_override_material(surface: int, material: Material)

Sets the override `material` for the specified `surface` of the Mesh resource.
This material is associated with this MeshInstance3D rather than with mesh.

Note: This assigns the Material associated to the MeshInstance3D's Surface
Material Override properties, not the material within the Mesh resource. To
set the material within the Mesh resource, use Mesh.surface_set_material()
instead.
