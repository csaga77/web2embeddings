Physically-based camera settings.

## Description

CameraAttributesPhysical is used to set rendering settings based on a
physically-based camera's settings. It is responsible for exposure, auto-
exposure, and depth of field.

When used in a WorldEnvironment it provides default settings for exposure,
auto-exposure, and depth of field that will be used by all cameras without
their own CameraAttributes, including the editor camera. When used in a
Camera3D it will override any CameraAttributes set in the WorldEnvironment and
will override the Camera3Ds Camera3D.far, Camera3D.near, Camera3D.fov, and
Camera3D.keep_aspect properties. When used in VoxelGI or LightmapGI, only the
exposure settings will be used.

The default settings are intended for use in an outdoor environment, tips for
settings for use in an indoor environment can be found in each setting's
documentation.

Note: Depth of field blur is only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile
rendering methods, not Compatibility.

## Property Descriptions

float auto_exposure_max_exposure_value = `10.0`

  * void set_auto_exposure_max_exposure_value(value: float)

  * float get_auto_exposure_max_exposure_value()

The maximum luminance (in EV100) used when calculating auto exposure. When
calculating scene average luminance, color values will be clamped to at least
this value. This limits the auto-exposure from exposing below a certain
brightness, resulting in a cut off point where the scene will remain bright.

float auto_exposure_min_exposure_value = `-8.0`

  * void set_auto_exposure_min_exposure_value(value: float)

  * float get_auto_exposure_min_exposure_value()

The minimum luminance (in EV100) used when calculating auto exposure. When
calculating scene average luminance, color values will be clamped to at least
this value. This limits the auto-exposure from exposing above a certain
brightness, resulting in a cut off point where the scene will remain dark.

float exposure_aperture = `16.0`

  * void set_aperture(value: float)

  * float get_aperture()

Size of the aperture of the camera, measured in f-stops. An f-stop is a
unitless ratio between the focal length of the camera and the diameter of the
aperture. A high aperture setting will result in a smaller aperture which
leads to a dimmer image and sharper focus. A low aperture results in a wide
aperture which lets in more light resulting in a brighter, less-focused image.
Default is appropriate for outdoors at daytime (i.e. for use with a default
DirectionalLight3D), for indoor lighting, a value between 2 and 4 is more
appropriate.

Only available when
ProjectSettings.rendering/lights_and_shadows/use_physical_light_units is
enabled.

float exposure_shutter_speed = `100.0`

  * void set_shutter_speed(value: float)

  * float get_shutter_speed()

Time for shutter to open and close, evaluated as `1 / shutter_speed` seconds.
A higher value will allow less light (leading to a darker image), while a
lower value will allow more light (leading to a brighter image).

Only available when
ProjectSettings.rendering/lights_and_shadows/use_physical_light_units is
enabled.

float frustum_far = `4000.0`

  * void set_far(value: float)

  * float get_far()

Override value for Camera3D.far. Used internally when calculating depth of
field. When attached to a Camera3D as its Camera3D.attributes, it will
override the Camera3D.far property.

float frustum_focal_length = `35.0`

  * void set_focal_length(value: float)

  * float get_focal_length()

Distance between camera lens and camera aperture, measured in millimeters.
Controls field of view and depth of field. A larger focal length will result
in a smaller field of view and a narrower depth of field meaning fewer objects
will be in focus. A smaller focal length will result in a wider field of view
and a larger depth of field meaning more objects will be in focus. When
attached to a Camera3D as its Camera3D.attributes, it will override the
Camera3D.fov property and the Camera3D.keep_aspect property.

float frustum_focus_distance = `10.0`

  * void set_focus_distance(value: float)

  * float get_focus_distance()

Distance from camera of object that will be in focus, measured in meters.
Internally this will be clamped to be at least 1 millimeter larger than
frustum_focal_length.

float frustum_near = `0.05`

  * void set_near(value: float)

  * float get_near()

Override value for Camera3D.near. Used internally when calculating depth of
field. When attached to a Camera3D as its Camera3D.attributes, it will
override the Camera3D.near property.

## Method Descriptions

float get_fov() const

Returns the vertical field of view that corresponds to the
frustum_focal_length. This value is calculated internally whenever
frustum_focal_length is changed.
