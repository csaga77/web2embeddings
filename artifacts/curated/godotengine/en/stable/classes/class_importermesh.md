# ImporterMesh

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

A Resource that contains vertex array-based geometry during the import
process.

## Description

ImporterMesh is a type of Resource analogous to ArrayMesh. It contains vertex
array-based geometry, divided in surfaces. Each surface contains a completely
separate array and a material used to draw it. Design wise, a mesh with
multiple surfaces is preferred to a single surface, because objects created in
3D editing software commonly contain multiple materials.

Unlike its runtime counterpart, ImporterMesh contains mesh data before various
import steps, such as lod and shadow mesh generation, have taken place. Modify
surface data by calling clear(), followed by add_surface() for each surface.

## Method Descriptions

void add_blend_shape(name: String)

Adds name for a blend shape that will be added with add_surface(). Must be
called before surface is added.

void add_surface(primitive: PrimitiveType, arrays: Array, blend_shapes:
Array[Array] = [], lods: Dictionary = {}, material: Material = null, name:
String = "", flags: int = 0)

Creates a new surface. Mesh.get_surface_count() will become the `surf_idx` for
this new surface.

Surfaces are created to be rendered using a `primitive`, which may be any of
the values defined in PrimitiveType.

The `arrays` argument is an array of arrays. Each of the Mesh.ARRAY_MAX
elements contains an array with some of the mesh data for this surface as
described by the corresponding member of ArrayType or `null` if it is not used
by the surface. For example, `arrays[0]` is the array of vertices. That first
vertex sub-array is always required; the others are optional. Adding an index
array puts this surface into "index mode" where the vertex and other arrays
become the sources of data and the index array defines the vertex order. All
sub-arrays must have the same length as the vertex array (or be an exact
multiple of the vertex array's length, when multiple elements of a sub-array
correspond to a single vertex) or be empty, except for Mesh.ARRAY_INDEX if it
is used.

The `blend_shapes` argument is an array of vertex data for each blend shape.
Each element is an array of the same structure as `arrays`, but
Mesh.ARRAY_VERTEX, Mesh.ARRAY_NORMAL, and Mesh.ARRAY_TANGENT are set if and
only if they are set in `arrays` and all other entries are `null`.

The `lods` argument is a dictionary with float keys and PackedInt32Array
values. Each entry in the dictionary represents an LOD level of the surface,
where the value is the Mesh.ARRAY_INDEX array to use for the LOD level and the
key is roughly proportional to the distance at which the LOD stats being used.
I.e., increasing the key of an LOD also increases the distance that the
objects has to be from the camera before the LOD is used.

The `flags` argument is the bitwise OR of, as required: One value of
ArrayCustomFormat left shifted by `ARRAY_FORMAT_CUSTOMn_SHIFT` for each custom
channel in use, Mesh.ARRAY_FLAG_USE_DYNAMIC_UPDATE,
Mesh.ARRAY_FLAG_USE_8_BONE_WEIGHTS, or
Mesh.ARRAY_FLAG_USES_EMPTY_VERTEX_ARRAY.

Note: When using indices, it is recommended to only use points, lines, or
triangles.

void clear()

Removes all surfaces and blend shapes from this ImporterMesh.

void generate_lods(normal_merge_angle: float, normal_split_angle: float,
bone_transform_array: Array)

Generates all lods for this ImporterMesh.

`normal_merge_angle` is in degrees and used in the same way as the importer
settings in `lods`.

`normal_split_angle` is not used and only remains for compatibility with older
versions of the API.

The number of generated lods can be accessed using get_surface_lod_count(),
and each LOD is available in get_surface_lod_size() and
get_surface_lod_indices().

`bone_transform_array` is an Array which can be either empty or contain
Transform3Ds which, for each of the mesh's bone IDs, will apply mesh skinning
when generating the LOD mesh variations. This is usually used to account for
discrepancies in scale between the mesh itself and its skinning data.

int get_blend_shape_count() const

Returns the number of blend shapes that the mesh holds.

BlendShapeMode get_blend_shape_mode() const

Returns the blend shape mode for this Mesh.

String get_blend_shape_name(blend_shape_idx: int) const

Returns the name of the blend shape at this index.

Vector2i get_lightmap_size_hint() const

Returns the size hint of this mesh for lightmap-unwrapping in UV-space.

ArrayMesh get_mesh(base_mesh: ArrayMesh = null)

Returns the mesh data represented by this ImporterMesh as a usable ArrayMesh.

This method caches the returned mesh, and subsequent calls will return the
cached data until clear() is called.

If not yet cached and `base_mesh` is provided, `base_mesh` will be used and
mutated.

Array get_surface_arrays(surface_idx: int) const

Returns the arrays for the vertices, normals, UVs, etc. that make up the
requested surface. See add_surface().

Array get_surface_blend_shape_arrays(surface_idx: int, blend_shape_idx: int)
const

Returns a single set of blend shape arrays for the requested blend shape index
for a surface.

int get_surface_count() const

Returns the number of surfaces that the mesh holds.

int get_surface_format(surface_idx: int) const

Returns the format of the surface that the mesh holds.

int get_surface_lod_count(surface_idx: int) const

Returns the number of lods that the mesh holds on a given surface.

PackedInt32Array get_surface_lod_indices(surface_idx: int, lod_idx: int) const

Returns the index buffer of a lod for a surface.

float get_surface_lod_size(surface_idx: int, lod_idx: int) const

Returns the screen ratio which activates a lod for a surface.

Material get_surface_material(surface_idx: int) const

Returns a Material in a given surface. Surface is rendered using this
material.

String get_surface_name(surface_idx: int) const

Gets the name assigned to this surface.

PrimitiveType get_surface_primitive_type(surface_idx: int)

Returns the primitive type of the requested surface (see add_surface()).

void set_blend_shape_mode(mode: BlendShapeMode)

Sets the blend shape mode to one of BlendShapeMode.

void set_lightmap_size_hint(size: Vector2i)

Sets the size hint of this mesh for lightmap-unwrapping in UV-space.

void set_surface_material(surface_idx: int, material: Material)

Sets a Material for a given surface. Surface will be rendered using this
material.

Sets a name for a given surface.
