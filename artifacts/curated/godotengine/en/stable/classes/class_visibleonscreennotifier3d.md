# VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D

Inherits: VisualInstance3D < Node3D < Node < Object

Inherited By: VisibleOnScreenEnabler3D

A box-shaped region of 3D space that detects whether it is visible on screen.

## Description

VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D represents a box-shaped region of 3D space. When any
part of this region becomes visible on screen or in a Camera3D's view, it will
emit a screen_entered signal, and likewise it will emit a screen_exited signal
when no part of it remains visible.

If you want a node to be enabled automatically when this region is visible on
screen, use VisibleOnScreenEnabler3D.

Note: VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D uses an approximate heuristic that doesn't
take walls and other occlusion into account, unless occlusion culling is used.
It also won't function unless Node3D.visible is set to `true`.

## Properties

AABB | aabb | `AABB(-1, -1, -1, 2, 2, 2)`  
---|---|---  
  
## Methods

bool | is_on_screen() const  
---|---  
  
## Signals

screen_entered()

Emitted when the VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D enters the screen.

screen_exited()

Emitted when the VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D exits the screen.

## Property Descriptions

AABB aabb = `AABB(-1, -1, -1, 2, 2, 2)`

  * void set_aabb(value: AABB)

  * AABB get_aabb()

The VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D's bounding box.

## Method Descriptions

bool is_on_screen() const

Returns `true` if the bounding box is on the screen.

Note: It takes one frame for the VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D's visibility to be
assessed once added to the scene tree, so this method will always return
`false` right after it is instantiated.
