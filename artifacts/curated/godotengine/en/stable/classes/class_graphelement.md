# GraphElement

Experimental: This class may be changed or removed in future versions.

Inherits: Container < Control < CanvasItem < Node < Object

Inherited By: GraphFrame, GraphNode

A container that represents a basic element that can be placed inside a
GraphEdit control.

## Description

GraphElement allows to create custom elements for a GraphEdit graph. By
default such elements can be selected, resized, and repositioned, but they
cannot be connected. For a graph element that allows for connections see
GraphNode.

## Properties

bool | draggable | `true`  
---|---|---  
Vector2 | position_offset | `Vector2(0, 0)`  
bool | resizable | `false`  
bool | selectable | `true`  
bool | selected | `false`

## Signals

delete_request()

Emitted when removing the GraphElement is requested.

dragged(from: Vector2, to: Vector2)

Emitted when the GraphElement is dragged.

node_deselected()

Emitted when the GraphElement is deselected.

node_selected()

Emitted when the GraphElement is selected.

position_offset_changed()

Emitted when the GraphElement is moved.

raise_request()

Emitted when displaying the GraphElement over other ones is requested. Happens
on focusing (clicking into) the GraphElement.

resize_end(new_size: Vector2)

Emitted when releasing the mouse button after dragging the resizer handle (see
resizable).

resize_request(new_size: Vector2)

Emitted when resizing the GraphElement is requested. Happens on dragging the
resizer handle (see resizable).

## Property Descriptions

bool draggable = `true`

  * void set_draggable(value: bool)

  * bool is_draggable()

If `true`, the user can drag the GraphElement.

Vector2 position_offset = `Vector2(0, 0)`

  * void set_position_offset(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_position_offset()

The offset of the GraphElement, relative to the scroll offset of the
GraphEdit.

bool resizable = `false`

  * void set_resizable(value: bool)

  * bool is_resizable()

If `true`, the user can resize the GraphElement.

Note: Dragging the handle will only emit the resize_request and resize_end
signals, the GraphElement needs to be resized manually.

bool selectable = `true`

  * void set_selectable(value: bool)

  * bool is_selectable()

If `true`, the user can select the GraphElement.

bool selected = `false`

  * void set_selected(value: bool)

  * bool is_selected()

If `true`, the GraphElement is selected.

## Theme Property Descriptions

Texture2D resizer

The icon used for the resizer, visible when resizable is enabled.
