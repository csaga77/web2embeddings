## Property Descriptions

CameraAttributes camera_attributes

  * void set_camera_attributes(value: CameraAttributes)

  * CameraAttributes get_camera_attributes()

The default CameraAttributes resource to use if none set on the Camera3D.

PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D direct_space_state

  * PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D get_direct_space_state()

Direct access to the world's physics 3D space state. Used for querying current
and potential collisions. When using multi-threaded physics, access is limited
to Node._physics_process() in the main thread.

Environment environment

  * void set_environment(value: Environment)

  * Environment get_environment()

The World3D's Environment.

Environment fallback_environment

  * void set_fallback_environment(value: Environment)

  * Environment get_fallback_environment()

The World3D's fallback environment will be used if environment fails or is
missing.

RID navigation_map

  * RID get_navigation_map()

The RID of this world's navigation map. Used by the NavigationServer3D.

RID scenario

  * RID get_scenario()

The World3D's visual scenario.

RID space

  * RID get_space()

The World3D's physics space.
