Vibration haptic feedback.

## Description

This haptic feedback resource makes it possible to define a vibration based
haptic feedback pulse that can be triggered through actions in the OpenXR
action map.

## Properties

float | amplitude | `1.0`  
---|---|---  
int | duration | `-1`  
float | frequency | `0.0`  
  
## Property Descriptions

float amplitude = `1.0`

  * void set_amplitude(value: float)

  * float get_amplitude()

The amplitude of the pulse between `0.0` and `1.0`.

int duration = `-1`

  * void set_duration(value: int)

  * int get_duration()

The duration of the pulse in nanoseconds. Use `-1` for a minimum duration
pulse for the current XR runtime.

float frequency = `0.0`

  * void set_frequency(value: float)

  * float get_frequency()

The frequency of the pulse in Hz. `0.0` will let the XR runtime chose an
optimal frequency for the device used.
