# PacketPeerUDP

Inherits: PacketPeer < RefCounted < Object

UDP packet peer.

## Description

UDP packet peer. Can be used to send and receive raw UDP packets as well as
Variants.

Example: Send a packet:

    
    
    var peer = PacketPeerUDP.new()
    
    # Optionally, you can select the local port used to send the packet.
    peer.bind(4444)
    
    peer.set_dest_address("1.1.1.1", 4433)
    peer.put_packet("hello".to_utf8_buffer())
    

Example: Listen for packets:

    
    
    var peer
    
    func _ready():
        peer = PacketPeerUDP.new()
        peer.bind(4433)
    
    
    func _process(_delta):
        if peer.get_available_packet_count() > 0:
            var array_bytes = peer.get_packet()
            var packet_string = array_bytes.get_string_from_ascii()
            print("Received message: ", packet_string)
    

Note: When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the `INTERNET` permission
in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click
deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by
Android.

## Method Descriptions

Error bind(port: int, bind_address: String = "*", recv_buf_size: int = 65536)

Binds this PacketPeerUDP to the specified `port` and `bind_address` with a
buffer size `recv_buf_size`, allowing it to receive incoming packets.

If `bind_address` is set to `"*"` (default), the peer will be bound on all
available addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6).

If `bind_address` is set to `"0.0.0.0"` (for IPv4) or `"::"` (for IPv6), the
peer will be bound to all available addresses matching that IP type.

If `bind_address` is set to any valid address (e.g. `"192.168.1.101"`,
`"::1"`, etc.), the peer will only be bound to the interface with that address
(or fail if no interface with the given address exists).

void close()

Closes the PacketPeerUDP's underlying UDP socket.

Error connect_to_host(host: String, port: int)

Calling this method connects this UDP peer to the given `host`/`port` pair.
UDP is in reality connectionless, so this option only means that incoming
packets from different addresses are automatically discarded, and that
outgoing packets are always sent to the connected address (future calls to
set_dest_address() are not allowed). This method does not send any data to the
remote peer, to do that, use PacketPeer.put_var() or PacketPeer.put_packet()
as usual. See also UDPServer.

Note: Connecting to the remote peer does not help to protect from malicious
attacks like IP spoofing, etc. Think about using an encryption technique like
TLS or DTLS if you feel like your application is transferring sensitive
information.

int get_local_port() const

Returns the local port to which this peer is bound.

String get_packet_ip() const

Returns the IP of the remote peer that sent the last packet(that was received
with PacketPeer.get_packet() or PacketPeer.get_var()).

int get_packet_port() const

Returns the port of the remote peer that sent the last packet(that was
received with PacketPeer.get_packet() or PacketPeer.get_var()).

bool is_bound() const

Returns whether this PacketPeerUDP is bound to an address and can receive
packets.

bool is_socket_connected() const

Returns `true` if the UDP socket is open and has been connected to a remote
address. See connect_to_host().

Error join_multicast_group(multicast_address: String, interface_name: String)

Joins the multicast group specified by `multicast_address` using the interface
identified by `interface_name`.

You can join the same multicast group with multiple interfaces. Use
IP.get_local_interfaces() to know which are available.

Note: Some Android devices might require the `CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE`
permission for multicast to work.

Error leave_multicast_group(multicast_address: String, interface_name: String)

Removes the interface identified by `interface_name` from the multicast group
specified by `multicast_address`.

void set_broadcast_enabled(enabled: bool)

Enable or disable sending of broadcast packets (e.g.
`set_dest_address("255.255.255.255", 4343)`. This option is disabled by
default.

Note: Some Android devices might require the `CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE`
permission and this option to be enabled to receive broadcast packets too.

Error set_dest_address(host: String, port: int)

Sets the destination address and port for sending packets and variables. A
hostname will be resolved using DNS if needed.

Note: set_broadcast_enabled() must be enabled before sending packets to a
broadcast address (e.g. `255.255.255.255`).

Error wait()

Waits for a packet to arrive on the bound address. See bind().

Note: wait() can't be interrupted once it has been called. This can be worked
around by allowing the other party to send a specific "death pill" packet like
this:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    socket = PacketPeerUDP.new()
    # Server
    socket.set_dest_address("127.0.0.1", 789)
    socket.put_packet("Time to stop".to_ascii_buffer())
    
    # Client
    while socket.wait() == OK:
        var data = socket.get_packet().get_string_from_ascii()
        if data == "Time to stop":
            return
    
    
    
    var socket = new PacketPeerUdp();
    // Server
    socket.SetDestAddress("127.0.0.1", 789);
    socket.PutPacket("Time to stop".ToAsciiBuffer());
    
    // Client
    while (socket.Wait() == OK)
    {
        string data = socket.GetPacket().GetStringFromASCII();
        if (data == "Time to stop")
        {
            return;
        }
    }
