# Timer

Inherits: Node < Object

A countdown timer.

## Description

The Timer node is a countdown timer and is the simplest way to handle time-
based logic in the engine. When a timer reaches the end of its wait_time, it
will emit the timeout signal.

After a timer enters the tree, it can be manually started with start(). A
timer node is also started automatically if autostart is `true`.

Without requiring much code, a timer node can be added and configured in the
editor. The timeout signal it emits can also be connected through the Node
dock in the editor:

    
    
    func _on_timer_timeout():
        print("Time to attack!")
    

Note: To create a one-shot timer without instantiating a node, use
SceneTree.create_timer().

Note: Timers are affected by Engine.time_scale. The higher the time scale, the
sooner timers will end. How often a timer processes may depend on the
framerate or Engine.physics_ticks_per_second.

## Properties

bool | autostart | `false`  
---|---|---  
bool | ignore_time_scale | `false`  
bool | one_shot | `false`  
bool | paused  
TimerProcessCallback | process_callback | `1`

## Methods

bool | is_stopped() const  
---|---  
void | start(time_sec: float = -1)  
void | stop()  
  
## Signals

timeout()

Emitted when the timer reaches the end.

## Enumerations

enum TimerProcessCallback:

TimerProcessCallback TIMER_PROCESS_PHYSICS = `0`

Update the timer every physics process frame (see
Node.NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_PHYSICS_PROCESS).

TimerProcessCallback TIMER_PROCESS_IDLE = `1`

Update the timer every process (rendered) frame (see
Node.NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_PROCESS).

## Property Descriptions

bool autostart = `false`

  * void set_autostart(value: bool)

  * bool has_autostart()

If `true`, the timer will start immediately when it enters the scene tree.

Note: After the timer enters the tree, this property is automatically set to
`false`.

Note: This property does nothing when the timer is running in the editor.

bool ignore_time_scale = `false`

  * void set_ignore_time_scale(value: bool)

  * bool is_ignoring_time_scale()

If `true`, the timer will ignore Engine.time_scale and update with the real,
elapsed time.

bool one_shot = `false`

  * void set_one_shot(value: bool)

  * bool is_one_shot()

If `true`, the timer will stop after reaching the end. Otherwise, as by
default, the timer will automatically restart.

bool paused

  * void set_paused(value: bool)

  * bool is_paused()

If `true`, the timer is paused. A paused timer does not process until this
property is set back to `false`, even when start() is called.

TimerProcessCallback process_callback = `1`

  * void set_timer_process_callback(value: TimerProcessCallback)

  * TimerProcessCallback get_timer_process_callback()

Specifies when the timer is updated during the main loop (see
TimerProcessCallback).

float time_left

  * float get_time_left()

The timer's remaining time in seconds. This is always `0` if the timer is
stopped.

Note: This property is read-only and cannot be modified. It is based on
wait_time.

float wait_time = `1.0`

  * void set_wait_time(value: float)

  * float get_wait_time()

The time required for the timer to end, in seconds. This property can also be
set every time start() is called.

Note: Timers can only process once per physics or process frame (depending on
the process_callback). An unstable framerate may cause the timer to end
inconsistently, which is especially noticeable if the wait time is lower than
roughly `0.05` seconds. For very short timers, it is recommended to write your
own code instead of using a Timer node. Timers are also affected by
Engine.time_scale.

## Method Descriptions

bool is_stopped() const

Returns `true` if the timer is stopped or has not started.

void start(time_sec: float = -1)

Starts the timer, or resets the timer if it was started already. Fails if the
timer is not inside the tree. If `time_sec` is greater than `0`, this value is
used for the wait_time.

Note: This method does not resume a paused timer. See paused.

void stop()

Stops the timer.
