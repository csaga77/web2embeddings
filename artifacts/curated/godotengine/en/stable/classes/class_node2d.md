A 2D game object, inherited by all 2D-related nodes. Has a position, rotation,
scale, and skew.

## Description

A 2D game object, with a transform (position, rotation, and scale). All 2D
nodes, including physics objects and sprites, inherit from Node2D. Use Node2D
as a parent node to move, scale and rotate children in a 2D project. Also
gives control of the node's render order.

Note: Since both Node2D and Control inherit from CanvasItem, they share
several concepts from the class such as the CanvasItem.z_index and
CanvasItem.visible properties.

## Property Descriptions

Vector2 global_position

  * void set_global_position(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_global_position()

Global position. See also position.

float global_rotation

  * void set_global_rotation(value: float)

  * float get_global_rotation()

Global rotation in radians. See also rotation.

float global_rotation_degrees

  * void set_global_rotation_degrees(value: float)

  * float get_global_rotation_degrees()

Helper property to access global_rotation in degrees instead of radians. See
also rotation_degrees.

Vector2 global_scale

  * void set_global_scale(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_global_scale()

Global scale. See also scale.

float global_skew

  * void set_global_skew(value: float)

  * float get_global_skew()

Global skew in radians. See also skew.

Transform2D global_transform

  * void set_global_transform(value: Transform2D)

  * Transform2D get_global_transform()

Global Transform2D. See also transform.

Vector2 position = `Vector2(0, 0)`

  * void set_position(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_position()

Position, relative to the node's parent. See also global_position.

float rotation = `0.0`

  * void set_rotation(value: float)

  * float get_rotation()

Rotation in radians, relative to the node's parent. See also global_rotation.

Note: This property is edited in the inspector in degrees. If you want to use
degrees in a script, use rotation_degrees.

float rotation_degrees

  * void set_rotation_degrees(value: float)

  * float get_rotation_degrees()

Helper property to access rotation in degrees instead of radians. See also
global_rotation_degrees.

Vector2 scale = `Vector2(1, 1)`

  * void set_scale(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_scale()

The node's scale, relative to the node's parent. Unscaled value: `(1, 1)`. See
also global_scale.

Note: Negative X scales in 2D are not decomposable from the transformation
matrix. Due to the way scale is represented with transformation matrices in
Godot, negative scales on the X axis will be changed to negative scales on the
Y axis and a rotation of 180 degrees when decomposed.

float skew = `0.0`

  * void set_skew(value: float)

  * float get_skew()

If set to a non-zero value, slants the node in one direction or another. This
can be used for pseudo-3D effects. See also global_skew.

Note: Skew is performed on the X axis only, and between rotation and scaling.

Note: This property is edited in the inspector in degrees. If you want to use
degrees in a script, use `skew = deg_to_rad(value_in_degrees)`.

Transform2D transform

  * void set_transform(value: Transform2D)

  * Transform2D get_transform()

The node's Transform2D, relative to the node's parent. See also
global_transform.

## Method Descriptions

void apply_scale(ratio: Vector2)

Multiplies the current scale by the `ratio` vector.

float get_angle_to(point: Vector2) const

Returns the angle between the node and the `point` in radians.

Illustration of the returned angle.

Transform2D get_relative_transform_to_parent(parent: Node) const

Returns the Transform2D relative to this node's parent.

void global_translate(offset: Vector2)

Adds the `offset` vector to the node's global position.

void look_at(point: Vector2)

Rotates the node so that its local +X axis points towards the `point`, which
is expected to use global coordinates.

`point` should not be the same as the node's position, otherwise the node
always looks to the right.

void move_local_x(delta: float, scaled: bool = false)

Applies a local translation on the node's X axis based on the
Node._process()'s `delta`. If `scaled` is `false`, normalizes the movement.

void move_local_y(delta: float, scaled: bool = false)

Applies a local translation on the node's Y axis based on the
Node._process()'s `delta`. If `scaled` is `false`, normalizes the movement.

void rotate(radians: float)

Applies a rotation to the node, in radians, starting from its current
rotation.

Vector2 to_global(local_point: Vector2) const

Transforms the provided local position into a position in global coordinate
space. The input is expected to be local relative to the Node2D it is called
on. e.g. Applying this method to the positions of child nodes will correctly
transform their positions into the global coordinate space, but applying it to
a node's own position will give an incorrect result, as it will incorporate
the node's own transformation into its global position.

Vector2 to_local(global_point: Vector2) const

Transforms the provided global position into a position in local coordinate
space. The output will be local relative to the Node2D it is called on. e.g.
It is appropriate for determining the positions of child nodes, but it is not
appropriate for determining its own position relative to its parent.

void translate(offset: Vector2)

Translates the node by the given `offset` in local coordinates.
