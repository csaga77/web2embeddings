# ResourceImporterDynamicFont

Inherits: ResourceImporter < RefCounted < Object

Imports a TTF, TTC, OTF, OTC, WOFF or WOFF2 font file for font rendering that
adapts to any size.

## Description

Unlike bitmap fonts, dynamic fonts can be resized to any size and still look
crisp. Dynamic fonts also optionally support MSDF font rendering, which allows
for run-time scale changes with no re-rasterization cost.

While WOFF and especially WOFF2 tend to result in smaller file sizes, there is
no universally "better" font format. In most situations, it's recommended to
use the font format that was shipped on the font developer's website.

## Property Descriptions

bool allow_system_fallback = `true`

If `true`, automatically use system fonts as a fallback if a glyph isn't found
in this dynamic font. This makes supporting CJK characters or emoji more
straightforward, as you don't need to include a CJK/emoji font in your
project. See also fallbacks.

Note: The appearance of system fonts varies across platforms. Loading system
fonts is only supported on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS.

int antialiasing = `1`

The font antialiasing method to use.

Disabled: Most suited for pixel art fonts, although you do not have to change
the antialiasing from the default Grayscale if the font file was well-created
and the font is used at an integer multiple of its intended size. If pixel art
fonts have a bad appearance at their intended size, try setting
subpixel_positioning to Disabled instead.

Grayscale: Use grayscale antialiasing. This is the approach used by the
operating system on macOS, Android and iOS.

LCD Subpixel: Use antialiasing with subpixel patterns to make fonts sharper on
LCD displays. This is the approach used by the operating system on Windows and
most Linux distributions. The downside is that this can introduce "fringing"
on edges, especially on display technologies that don't use standard RGB
subpixels (such as OLED displays). The LCD subpixel layout is globally
controlled by ProjectSettings.gui/theme/lcd_subpixel_layout, which also allows
falling back to grayscale antialiasing.

bool compress = `true`

If `true`, uses lossless compression for the resulting font.

bool disable_embedded_bitmaps = `true`

If set to `true`, embedded font bitmap loading is disabled (bitmap-only and
color fonts ignore this property).

Array fallbacks = `[]`

List of font fallbacks to use if a glyph isn't found in this dynamic font.
Fonts at the beginning of the array are attempted first, but fallback fonts
that don't support the glyph's language and script are attempted last (see
language_support and script_support). See also allow_system_fallback.

bool force_autohinter = `false`

If `true`, forces generation of hinting data for the font using FreeType's
autohinter. This will make hinting effective with fonts that don't include
hinting data.

bool generate_mipmaps = `false`

If `true`, this font will have mipmaps generated. This prevents text from
looking grainy when a Control is scaled down, or when a Label3D is viewed from
a long distance (if Label3D.texture_filter is set to a mode that displays
mipmaps).

Enabling generate_mipmaps increases font generation time and memory usage.
Only enable this setting if you actually need it.

int hinting = `1`

The hinting mode to use. This controls how aggressively glyph edges should be
snapped to pixels when rasterizing the font. Depending on personal preference,
you may prefer using one hinting mode over the other. Hinting modes other than
None are only effective if the font contains hinting data (see
force_autohinter).

None: Smoothest appearance, which can make the font look blurry at small
sizes.

Light: Sharp result by snapping glyph edges to pixels on the Y axis only.

Full: Sharpest by snapping glyph edges to pixels on both X and Y axes.

bool keep_rounding_remainders = `true`

If set to `true`, when aligning glyphs to the pixel boundaries rounding
remainders are accumulated to ensure more uniform glyph distribution. This
setting has no effect if subpixel positioning is enabled.

Dictionary language_support = `{}`

Override the list of languages supported by this font. If left empty, this is
supplied by the font metadata. There is usually no need to change this. See
also script_support.

int msdf_pixel_range = `8`

The width of the range around the shape between the minimum and maximum
representable signed distance. If using font outlines, msdf_pixel_range must
be set to at least twice the size of the largest font outline. The default
msdf_pixel_range value of `8` allows outline sizes up to `4` to look correct.

int msdf_size = `48`

Source font size used to generate MSDF textures. Higher values allow for more
precision, but are slower to render and require more memory. Only increase
this value if you notice a visible lack of precision in glyph rendering. Only
effective if multichannel_signed_distance_field is `true`.

bool multichannel_signed_distance_field = `false`

If set to `true`, the font will use multichannel signed distance field (MSDF)
for crisp rendering at any size. Since this approach does not rely on
rasterizing the font every time its size changes, this allows for resizing the
font in real-time without any performance penalty. Text will also not look
grainy for Controls that are scaled down (or for Label3Ds viewed from a long
distance).

MSDF font rendering can be combined with generate_mipmaps to further improve
font rendering quality when scaled down.

Dictionary opentype_features = `{}`

The OpenType features to enable, disable or set a value for this font. This
can be used to enable optional features provided by the font, such as
ligatures or alternative glyphs. The list of supported OpenType features
varies on a per-font basis.

float oversampling = `0.0`

If set to a value greater than `0.0`, overrides the oversampling factor for
the font. This can be used to render the font at a higher or lower resolution
than intended without affecting its physical size. In most cases, this should
be left at `0.0`.

Array preload = `[]`

The glyph ranges to prerender. This can avoid stuttering during gameplay when
new characters need to be rendered, especially if subpixel_positioning is
enabled. The downside of using preloading is that initial project load times
will increase, as well as memory usage.

Dictionary script_support = `{}`

Override the list of language scripts supported by this font. If left empty,
this is supplied by the font metadata. There is usually no need to change
this. See also language_support.

int subpixel_positioning = `4`

Subpixel positioning improves font rendering appearance, especially at smaller
font sizes. The downside is that it takes more time to initially render the
font, which can cause stuttering during gameplay, especially if used with
large font sizes. This should be set to Disabled for fonts with a pixel art
appearance.

Disabled: No subpixel positioning. Lowest quality, fastest rendering.

Auto: Use subpixel positioning at small font sizes (the chosen quality varies
depending on font size). Large fonts will not use subpixel positioning. This
is a good tradeoff between performance and quality.

One Half of a Pixel: Always perform intermediate subpixel positioning
regardless of font size. High quality, slow rendering.

One Quarter of a Pixel: Always perform precise subpixel positioning regardless
of font size. Highest quality, slowest rendering.

Auto (Except Pixel Fonts): Disabled for the pixel style fonts (each glyph
contours contain only straight horizontal and vertical lines), Auto for the
other fonts.
