# EditorScriptPicker

Inherits: EditorResourcePicker < HBoxContainer < BoxContainer < Container <
Control < CanvasItem < Node < Object

Godot editor's control for selecting the `script` property of a Node.

## Description

Similar to EditorResourcePicker this Control node is used in the editor's
Inspector dock, but only to edit the `script` property of a Node. Default
options for creating new resources of all possible subtypes are replaced with
dedicated buttons that open the "Attach Node Script" dialog. Can be used with
EditorInspectorPlugin to recreate the same behavior.

Note: You must set the script_owner for the custom context menu items to work.
