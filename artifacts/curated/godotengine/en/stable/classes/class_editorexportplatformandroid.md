## Property Descriptions

String apk_expansion/SALT

Array of random bytes that the licensing Policy uses to create an Obfuscator.

bool apk_expansion/enable

If `true`, project resources are stored in the separate APK expansion file,
instead of the APK.

Note: APK expansion should be enabled to use PCK encryption. See APK Expansion
Files

String apk_expansion/public_key

Base64 encoded RSA public key for your publisher account, available from the
profile page on the "Google Play Console".

bool architectures/arm64-v8a

If `true`, `arm64` binaries are included into exported project.

bool architectures/armeabi-v7a

If `true`, `arm32` binaries are included into exported project.

bool architectures/x86

If `true`, `x86_32` binaries are included into exported project.

bool architectures/x86_64

If `true`, `x86_64` binaries are included into exported project.

String command_line/extra_args

A list of additional command line arguments, separated by space, which the
exported project will receive when started.

String custom_template/debug

Path to an APK file to use as a custom export template for debug exports. If
left empty, default template is used.

Note: This is only used if gradle_build/use_gradle_build is disabled.

String custom_template/release

Path to an APK file to use as a custom export template for release exports. If
left empty, default template is used.

Note: This is only used if gradle_build/use_gradle_build is disabled.

bool gesture/swipe_to_dismiss

If `true`, Swipe to dismiss will be enabled.

This functionality is intended for smartwatches and is generally ignored on
standard Android devices. However, some devices may not ignore it. Therefore,
it is recommended to keep this feature disabled for standard Android apps to
avoid unexpected behavior.

Note: This is `false` by default. To enable this behavior,
gradle_build/use_gradle_build is required.

String gradle_build/android_source_template

Path to a ZIP file holding the source for the export template used in a Gradle
build. If left empty, the default template is used.

bool gradle_build/compress_native_libraries

If `true`, native libraries are compressed when performing a Gradle build.

Note: Although your binary may be smaller, your application may load slower
because the native libraries are not loaded directly from the binary at
runtime.

int gradle_build/export_format

Application export format (*.apk or *.aab).

String gradle_build/gradle_build_directory

Path to the Gradle build directory. If left empty, then `res://android` will
be used.

String gradle_build/min_sdk

Minimum Android API level required for the application to run (used during
Gradle build). See android:minSdkVersion.

String gradle_build/target_sdk

The Android API level on which the application is designed to run (used during
Gradle build). See android:targetSdkVersion.

bool gradle_build/use_gradle_build

If `true`, Gradle build is used instead of pre-built APK.

bool graphics/opengl_debug

If `true`, OpenGL ES debug context will be created (additional runtime
checking, validation, and logging).

String keystore/debug

Path of the debug keystore file.

Can be overridden with the environment variable
`GODOT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_DEBUG_PATH`.

Fallbacks to `EditorSettings.export/android/debug_keystore` if empty.

String keystore/debug_password

Password for the debug keystore file.

Can be overridden with the environment variable
`GODOT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_DEBUG_PASSWORD`.

Fallbacks to `EditorSettings.export/android/debug_keystore_pass` if both it
and keystore/debug are empty.

String keystore/debug_user

User name for the debug keystore file.

Can be overridden with the environment variable
`GODOT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_DEBUG_USER`.

Fallbacks to `EditorSettings.export/android/debug_keystore_user` if both it
and keystore/debug are empty.

String keystore/release

Path of the release keystore file.

Can be overridden with the environment variable
`GODOT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_RELEASE_PATH`.

String keystore/release_password

Password for the release keystore file.

Can be overridden with the environment variable
`GODOT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_RELEASE_PASSWORD`.

String keystore/release_user

User name for the release keystore file.

Can be overridden with the environment variable
`GODOT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_RELEASE_USER`.

String launcher_icons/adaptive_background_432x432

Background layer of the application adaptive icon file. See Design adaptive
icons.

String launcher_icons/adaptive_foreground_432x432

Foreground layer of the application adaptive icon file. See Design adaptive
icons.

String launcher_icons/adaptive_monochrome_432x432

Monochrome layer of the application adaptive icon file. See Design adaptive
icons.

String launcher_icons/main_192x192

Application icon file. If left empty, it will fallback to
ProjectSettings.application/config/icon.

int package/app_category

Application category for the Google Play Store. Only define this if your
application fits one of the categories well. See android:appCategory.

bool package/exclude_from_recents

If `true`, task initiated by main activity will be excluded from the list of
recently used applications. See android:excludeFromRecents.

String package/name

Name of the application.

bool package/retain_data_on_uninstall

If `true`, when the user uninstalls an app, a prompt to keep the app's data
will be shown. See android:hasFragileUserData.

bool package/show_as_launcher_app

If `true`, the user will be able to set this app as the system launcher in
Android preferences.

bool package/show_in_android_tv

If `true`, this app will show in Android TV launcher UI.

bool package/show_in_app_library

If `true`, this app will show in the device's app library.

Note: This is `true` by default.

bool package/signed

If `true`, package signing is enabled.

String package/unique_name

Unique application identifier in a reverse-DNS format. The reverse DNS format
should preferably match a domain name you control, but this is not strictly
required. For instance, if you own `example.com`, your package unique name
should preferably be of the form `com.example.mygame`. This identifier can
only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, and `0-9`), underscores
(`_`), and periods (`.`). Each component of the reverse DNS format must start
with a letter: for instance, `com.example.8game` is not valid.

If `$genname` is present in the value, it will be replaced by the project name
converted to lowercase. If there are invalid characters in the project name,
they will be stripped. If all characters in the project name are stripped,
`$genname` is replaced by `noname`.

Note: Changing the package name will cause the package to be considered as a
new package, with its own installation and data paths. The new package won't
be usable to update existing installations.

Note: When publishing to Google Play, the package name must be globally
unique. This means no other apps published on Google Play must be using the
same package name as yours. Otherwise, you'll be prevented from publishing
your app on Google Play.
