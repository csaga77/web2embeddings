# DirectionalLight2D

Inherits: Light2D < Node2D < CanvasItem < Node < Object

Directional 2D light from a distance.

## Description

A directional light is a type of Light2D node that models an infinite number
of parallel rays covering the entire scene. It is used for lights with strong
intensity that are located far away from the scene (for example: to model
sunlight or moonlight).

Note: DirectionalLight2D does not support light cull masks (but it supports
shadow cull masks). It will always light up 2D nodes, regardless of the 2D
node's CanvasItem.light_mask.

float | max_distance | `10000.0`  
  
## Property Descriptions

float height = `0.0`

  * void set_height(value: float)

  * float get_height()

The height of the light. Used with 2D normal mapping. Ranges from 0 (parallel
to the plane) to 1 (perpendicular to the plane).

float max_distance = `10000.0`

  * void set_max_distance(value: float)

  * float get_max_distance()

The maximum distance from the camera center objects can be before their
shadows are culled (in pixels). Decreasing this value can prevent objects
located outside the camera from casting shadows (while also improving
performance). Camera2D.zoom is not taken into account by max_distance, which
means that at higher zoom values, shadows will appear to fade out sooner when
zooming onto a given point.
