# ShaderInclude

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

A snippet of shader code to be included in a Shader with `#include`.

## Description

A shader include file, saved with the `.gdshaderinc` extension. This class
allows you to define a custom shader snippet that can be included in a Shader
by using the preprocessor directive `#include`, followed by the file path
(e.g. `#include "res://shader_lib.gdshaderinc"`). The snippet doesn't have to
be a valid shader on its own.
