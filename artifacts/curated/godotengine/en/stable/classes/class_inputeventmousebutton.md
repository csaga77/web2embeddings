Represents a mouse button being pressed or released.

## Description

Stores information about mouse click events. See Node._input().

Note: On Wear OS devices, rotary input is mapped to
@GlobalScope.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_UP and @GlobalScope.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_DOWN.
This can be changed to @GlobalScope.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_LEFT and
@GlobalScope.MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_RIGHT with the
ProjectSettings.input_devices/pointing/android/rotary_input_scroll_axis
setting.

  * float get_factor()

The amount (or delta) of the event. When used for high-precision scroll
