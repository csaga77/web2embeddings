# NavigationRegion3D

Experimental: This class may be changed or removed in future versions.

Inherits: Node3D < Node < Object

A traversable 3D region that NavigationAgent3Ds can use for pathfinding.

## Description

A traversable 3D region based on a NavigationMesh that NavigationAgent3Ds can
use for pathfinding.

Two regions can be connected to each other if they share a similar edge. You
can set the minimum distance between two vertices required to connect two
edges by using NavigationServer3D.map_set_edge_connection_margin().

Note: Overlapping two regions' navigation meshes is not enough for connecting
two regions. They must share a similar edge.

The cost of entering this region from another region can be controlled with
the enter_cost value.

Note: This value is not added to the path cost when the start position is
already inside this region.

The cost of traveling distances inside this region can be controlled with the
travel_cost multiplier.

Note: This node caches changes to its properties, so if you make changes to
the underlying region RID in NavigationServer3D, they will not be reflected in
this node's properties.

## Signals

bake_finished()

Notifies when the navigation mesh bake operation is completed.

navigation_mesh_changed()

Notifies when the NavigationMesh has changed.

## Property Descriptions

bool enabled = `true`

  * void set_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_enabled()

Determines if the NavigationRegion3D is enabled or disabled.

float enter_cost = `0.0`

  * void set_enter_cost(value: float)

  * float get_enter_cost()

When pathfinding enters this region's navigation mesh from another regions
navigation mesh the enter_cost value is added to the path distance for
determining the shortest path.

int navigation_layers = `1`

  * void set_navigation_layers(value: int)

  * int get_navigation_layers()

A bitfield determining all navigation layers the region belongs to. These
navigation layers can be checked upon when requesting a path with
NavigationServer3D.map_get_path().

NavigationMesh navigation_mesh

  * void set_navigation_mesh(value: NavigationMesh)

  * NavigationMesh get_navigation_mesh()

The NavigationMesh resource to use.

float travel_cost = `1.0`

  * void set_travel_cost(value: float)

  * float get_travel_cost()

When pathfinding moves inside this region's navigation mesh the traveled
distances are multiplied with travel_cost for determining the shortest path.

bool use_edge_connections = `true`

  * void set_use_edge_connections(value: bool)

  * bool get_use_edge_connections()

If enabled the navigation region will use edge connections to connect with
other navigation regions within proximity of the navigation map edge
connection margin.

## Method Descriptions

void bake_navigation_mesh(on_thread: bool = true)

Bakes the NavigationMesh. If `on_thread` is set to `true` (default), the
baking is done on a separate thread. Baking on separate thread is useful
because navigation baking is not a cheap operation. When it is completed, it
automatically sets the new NavigationMesh. Please note that baking on separate
thread may be very slow if geometry is parsed from meshes as async access to
each mesh involves heavy synchronization. Also, please note that baking on a
separate thread is automatically disabled on operating systems that cannot use
threads (such as Web with threads disabled).

AABB get_bounds() const

Returns the axis-aligned bounding box for the region's transformed navigation
mesh.

bool get_navigation_layer_value(layer_number: int) const

Returns whether or not the specified layer of the navigation_layers bitmask is
enabled, given a `layer_number` between 1 and 32.

RID get_navigation_map() const

Returns the current navigation map RID used by this region.

RID get_region_rid() const

Deprecated: Use get_rid() instead.

Returns the RID of this region on the NavigationServer3D.

RID get_rid() const

Returns the RID of this region on the NavigationServer3D. Combined with
NavigationServer3D.map_get_closest_point_owner() can be used to identify the
NavigationRegion3D closest to a point on the merged navigation map.

bool is_baking() const

Returns `true` when the NavigationMesh is being baked on a background thread.

void set_navigation_layer_value(layer_number: int, value: bool)

Based on `value`, enables or disables the specified layer in the
navigation_layers bitmask, given a `layer_number` between 1 and 32.

void set_navigation_map(navigation_map: RID)

Sets the RID of the navigation map this region should use. By default the
region will automatically join the World3D default navigation map so this
function is only required to override the default map.
