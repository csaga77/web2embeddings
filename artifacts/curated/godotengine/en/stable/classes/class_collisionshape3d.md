# CollisionShape3D

Inherits: Node3D < Node < Object

A node that provides a Shape3D to a CollisionObject3D parent.

## Description

A node that provides a Shape3D to a CollisionObject3D parent and allows to
edit it. This can give a detection shape to an Area3D or turn a PhysicsBody3D
into a solid object.

Warning: A non-uniformly scaled CollisionShape3D will likely not behave as
expected. Make sure to keep its scale the same on all axes and adjust its
shape resource instead.

## Properties

Color | debug_color | `Color(0, 0, 0, 0)`  
---|---|---  
bool | debug_fill | `true`  
bool | disabled | `false`  
Shape3D | shape  
  
## Methods

void | make_convex_from_siblings()  
---|---  
void | resource_changed(resource: Resource)  
  
## Property Descriptions

Color debug_color = `Color(0, 0, 0, 0)`

  * void set_debug_color(value: Color)

  * Color get_debug_color()

The collision shape color that is displayed in the editor, or in the running
project if Debug > Visible Collision Shapes is checked at the top of the
editor.

Note: The default value is ProjectSettings.debug/shapes/collision/shape_color.
The `Color(0, 0, 0, 0)` value documented here is a placeholder, and not the
actual default debug color.

bool debug_fill = `true`

  * void set_enable_debug_fill(value: bool)

  * bool get_enable_debug_fill()

If `true`, when the shape is displayed, it will show a solid fill color in
addition to its wireframe.

bool disabled = `false`

  * void set_disabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_disabled()

A disabled collision shape has no effect in the world.

Shape3D shape

  * void set_shape(value: Shape3D)

  * Shape3D get_shape()

The actual shape owned by this collision shape.

## Method Descriptions

void make_convex_from_siblings()

Sets the collision shape's shape to the addition of all its convexed
MeshInstance3D siblings geometry.

void resource_changed(resource: Resource)

Deprecated: Use Resource.changed instead.

This method does nothing.
