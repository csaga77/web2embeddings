# EngineProfiler

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Base class for creating custom profilers.

## Description

This class can be used to implement custom profilers that are able to interact
with the engine and editor debugger.

See EngineDebugger and EditorDebuggerPlugin for more information.

## Methods

void | _add_frame(data: Array) virtual  
---|---  
void | _tick(frame_time: float, process_time: float, physics_time: float, physics_frame_time: float) virtual  
void | _toggle(enable: bool, options: Array) virtual  
  
## Method Descriptions

void _add_frame(data: Array) virtual

Called when data is added to profiler using
EngineDebugger.profiler_add_frame_data().

void _tick(frame_time: float, process_time: float, physics_time: float,
physics_frame_time: float) virtual

Called once every engine iteration when the profiler is active with
information about the current frame. All time values are in seconds. Lower
values represent faster processing times and are therefore considered better.

void _toggle(enable: bool, options: Array) virtual

Called when the profiler is enabled/disabled, along with a set of `options`.
