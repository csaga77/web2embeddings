# RDPipelineColorBlendStateAttachment

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Pipeline color blend state attachment (used by RenderingDevice).

## Description

Controls how blending between source and destination fragments is performed
when using RenderingDevice.

For reference, this is how common user-facing blend modes are implemented in
Godot's 2D renderer:

Mix:

    
    
    var attachment = RDPipelineColorBlendStateAttachment.new()
    attachment.enable_blend = true
    attachment.color_blend_op = RenderingDevice.BLEND_OP_ADD
    attachment.src_color_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_SRC_ALPHA
    attachment.dst_color_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA
    attachment.alpha_blend_op = RenderingDevice.BLEND_OP_ADD
    attachment.src_alpha_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_ONE
    attachment.dst_alpha_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA
    

Add:

    
    
    var attachment = RDPipelineColorBlendStateAttachment.new()
    attachment.enable_blend = true
    attachment.alpha_blend_op = RenderingDevice.BLEND_OP_ADD
    attachment.color_blend_op = RenderingDevice.BLEND_OP_ADD
    attachment.src_color_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_SRC_ALPHA
    attachment.dst_color_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_ONE
    attachment.src_alpha_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_SRC_ALPHA
    attachment.dst_alpha_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_ONE
    

Subtract:

    
    
    var attachment = RDPipelineColorBlendStateAttachment.new()
    attachment.enable_blend = true
    attachment.alpha_blend_op = RenderingDevice.BLEND_OP_REVERSE_SUBTRACT
    attachment.color_blend_op = RenderingDevice.BLEND_OP_REVERSE_SUBTRACT
    attachment.src_color_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_SRC_ALPHA
    attachment.dst_color_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_ONE
    attachment.src_alpha_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_SRC_ALPHA
    attachment.dst_alpha_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_ONE
    

Multiply:

    
    
    var attachment = RDPipelineColorBlendStateAttachment.new()
    attachment.enable_blend = true
    attachment.alpha_blend_op = RenderingDevice.BLEND_OP_ADD
    attachment.color_blend_op = RenderingDevice.BLEND_OP_ADD
    attachment.src_color_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_DST_COLOR
    attachment.dst_color_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_ZERO
    attachment.src_alpha_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_DST_ALPHA
    attachment.dst_alpha_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_ZERO
    

Pre-multiplied alpha:

    
    
    var attachment = RDPipelineColorBlendStateAttachment.new()
    attachment.enable_blend = true
    attachment.alpha_blend_op = RenderingDevice.BLEND_OP_ADD
    attachment.color_blend_op = RenderingDevice.BLEND_OP_ADD
    attachment.src_color_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_ONE
    attachment.dst_color_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA
    attachment.src_alpha_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_ONE
    attachment.dst_alpha_blend_factor = RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA

## Property Descriptions

BlendOperation alpha_blend_op = `0`

  * void set_alpha_blend_op(value: BlendOperation)

  * BlendOperation get_alpha_blend_op()

The blend mode to use for the alpha channel.

BlendOperation color_blend_op = `0`

  * void set_color_blend_op(value: BlendOperation)

  * BlendOperation get_color_blend_op()

The blend mode to use for the red/green/blue color channels.

BlendFactor dst_alpha_blend_factor = `0`

  * void set_dst_alpha_blend_factor(value: BlendFactor)

  * BlendFactor get_dst_alpha_blend_factor()

Controls how the blend factor for the alpha channel is determined based on the
destination's fragments.

BlendFactor dst_color_blend_factor = `0`

  * void set_dst_color_blend_factor(value: BlendFactor)

  * BlendFactor get_dst_color_blend_factor()

Controls how the blend factor for the color channels is determined based on
the destination's fragments.

bool enable_blend = `false`

  * void set_enable_blend(value: bool)

  * bool get_enable_blend()

If `true`, performs blending between the source and destination according to
the factors defined in src_color_blend_factor, dst_color_blend_factor,
src_alpha_blend_factor and dst_alpha_blend_factor. The blend modes
color_blend_op and alpha_blend_op are also taken into account, with write_r,
write_g, write_b and write_a controlling the output.

BlendFactor src_alpha_blend_factor = `0`

  * void set_src_alpha_blend_factor(value: BlendFactor)

  * BlendFactor get_src_alpha_blend_factor()

Controls how the blend factor for the alpha channel is determined based on the
source's fragments.

BlendFactor src_color_blend_factor = `0`

  * void set_src_color_blend_factor(value: BlendFactor)

  * BlendFactor get_src_color_blend_factor()

Controls how the blend factor for the color channels is determined based on
the source's fragments.

bool write_a = `true`

  * void set_write_a(value: bool)

  * bool get_write_a()

If `true`, writes the new alpha channel to the final result.

bool write_b = `true`

  * void set_write_b(value: bool)

  * bool get_write_b()

If `true`, writes the new blue color channel to the final result.

bool write_g = `true`

  * void set_write_g(value: bool)

  * bool get_write_g()

If `true`, writes the new green color channel to the final result.

bool write_r = `true`

  * void set_write_r(value: bool)

  * bool get_write_r()

If `true`, writes the new red color channel to the final result.

## Method Descriptions

void set_as_mix()

Convenience method to perform standard mix blending with straight (non-
premultiplied) alpha. This sets enable_blend to `true`, src_color_blend_factor
to RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_SRC_ALPHA, dst_color_blend_factor to
RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, src_alpha_blend_factor to
RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_SRC_ALPHA and dst_alpha_blend_factor to
RenderingDevice.BLEND_FACTOR_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA.
