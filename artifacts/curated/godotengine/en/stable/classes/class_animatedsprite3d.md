2D sprite node in 3D world, that can use multiple 2D textures for animation.

## Description

AnimatedSprite3D is similar to the Sprite3D node, except it carries multiple
textures as animation sprite_frames. Animations are created using a
SpriteFrames resource, which allows you to import image files (or a folder
containing said files) to provide the animation frames for the sprite. The
SpriteFrames resource can be configured in the editor via the SpriteFrames
bottom panel.

## Properties

StringName | animation | `&"default"`  
---|---|---  
String | autoplay | `""`  
int | frame | `0`  
float | frame_progress | `0.0`  
float | speed_scale | `1.0`  
SpriteFrames | sprite_frames  
  
## Methods

float | get_playing_speed() const  
---|---  
bool | is_playing() const  
void | pause()  
void | play(name: StringName = &"", custom_speed: float = 1.0, from_end: bool = false)  
void | play_backwards(name: StringName = &"")  
void | set_frame_and_progress(frame: int, progress: float)  
void | stop()  
  
## Signals

animation_changed()

Emitted when animation changes.

animation_finished()

Emitted when the animation reaches the end, or the start if it is played in
reverse. When the animation finishes, it pauses the playback.

Note: This signal is not emitted if an animation is looping.

animation_looped()

Emitted when the animation loops.

frame_changed()

Emitted when frame changes.

sprite_frames_changed()

Emitted when sprite_frames changes.

## Property Descriptions

StringName animation = `&"default"`

  * void set_animation(value: StringName)

  * StringName get_animation()

The current animation from the sprite_frames resource. If this value is
changed, the frame counter and the frame_progress are reset.

String autoplay = `""`

  * void set_autoplay(value: String)

  * String get_autoplay()

The key of the animation to play when the scene loads.

int frame = `0`

  * void set_frame(value: int)

  * int get_frame()

The displayed animation frame's index. Setting this property also resets
frame_progress. If this is not desired, use set_frame_and_progress().

float frame_progress = `0.0`

  * void set_frame_progress(value: float)

  * float get_frame_progress()

The progress value between `0.0` and `1.0` until the current frame transitions
to the next frame. If the animation is playing backwards, the value
transitions from `1.0` to `0.0`.

float speed_scale = `1.0`

  * void set_speed_scale(value: float)

  * float get_speed_scale()

The speed scaling ratio. For example, if this value is `1`, then the animation
plays at normal speed. If it's `0.5`, then it plays at half speed. If it's
`2`, then it plays at double speed.

If set to a negative value, the animation is played in reverse. If set to `0`,
the animation will not advance.

SpriteFrames sprite_frames

  * void set_sprite_frames(value: SpriteFrames)

  * SpriteFrames get_sprite_frames()

The SpriteFrames resource containing the animation(s). Allows you the option
to load, edit, clear, make unique and save the states of the SpriteFrames
resource.

## Method Descriptions

float get_playing_speed() const

Returns the actual playing speed of current animation or `0` if not playing.
This speed is the speed_scale property multiplied by `custom_speed` argument
specified when calling the play() method.

Returns a negative value if the current animation is playing backwards.

bool is_playing() const

Returns `true` if an animation is currently playing (even if speed_scale
and/or `custom_speed` are `0`).

void pause()

Pauses the currently playing animation. The frame and frame_progress will be
kept and calling play() or play_backwards() without arguments will resume the
animation from the current playback position.

See also stop().

void play(name: StringName = &"", custom_speed: float = 1.0, from_end: bool =
false)

Plays the animation with key `name`. If `custom_speed` is negative and
`from_end` is `true`, the animation will play backwards (which is equivalent
to calling play_backwards()).

If this method is called with that same animation `name`, or with no `name`
parameter, the assigned animation will resume playing if it was paused.

void play_backwards(name: StringName = &"")

Plays the animation with key `name` in reverse.

This method is a shorthand for play() with `custom_speed = -1.0` and `from_end
= true`, so see its description for more information.

void set_frame_and_progress(frame: int, progress: float)

Sets frame the frame_progress to the given values. Unlike setting frame, this
method does not reset the frame_progress to `0.0` implicitly.

Example: Change the animation while keeping the same frame and frame_progress:

GDScript

    
    
    var current_frame = animated_sprite.get_frame()
    var current_progress = animated_sprite.get_frame_progress()
    animated_sprite.play("walk_another_skin")
    animated_sprite.set_frame_and_progress(current_frame, current_progress)
    

void stop()

Stops the currently playing animation. The animation position is reset to `0`
and the `custom_speed` is reset to `1.0`. See also pause().
