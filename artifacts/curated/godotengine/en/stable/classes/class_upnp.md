# UPNP

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) functions for network device discovery,
querying and port forwarding.

## Description

This class can be used to discover compatible UPNPDevices on the local network
and execute commands on them, like managing port mappings (for port
forwarding/NAT traversal) and querying the local and remote network IP
address. Note that methods on this class are synchronous and block the calling
thread.

To forward a specific port (here `7777`, note both discover() and
add_port_mapping() can return errors that should be checked):

    
    
    var upnp = UPNP.new()
    upnp.discover()
    upnp.add_port_mapping(7777)
    

To close a specific port (e.g. after you have finished using it):

    
    
    upnp.delete_port_mapping(port)
    

Note: UPnP discovery blocks the current thread. To perform discovery without
blocking the main thread, use Threads like this:

    
    
    # Emitted when UPnP port mapping setup is completed (regardless of success or failure).
    signal upnp_completed(error)
    
    # Replace this with your own server port number between 1024 and 65535.
    const SERVER_PORT = 3928
    var thread = null
    
    func _upnp_setup(server_port):
        # UPNP queries take some time.
        var upnp = UPNP.new()
        var err = upnp.discover()
    
        if err != OK:
            push_error(str(err))
            upnp_completed.emit(err)
            return
    
        if upnp.get_gateway() and upnp.get_gateway().is_valid_gateway():
            upnp.add_port_mapping(server_port, server_port, ProjectSettings.get_setting("application/config/name"), "UDP")
            upnp.add_port_mapping(server_port, server_port, ProjectSettings.get_setting("application/config/name"), "TCP")
            upnp_completed.emit(OK)
    
    func _ready():
        thread = Thread.new()
        thread.start(_upnp_setup.bind(SERVER_PORT))
    
    func _exit_tree():
        # Wait for thread finish here to handle game exit while the thread is running.
        thread.wait_to_finish()
    

Terminology: In the context of UPnP networking, "gateway" (or "internet
gateway device", short IGD) refers to network devices that allow computers in
the local network to access the internet ("wide area network", WAN). These
gateways are often also called "routers".

Pitfalls:

  * As explained above, these calls are blocking and shouldn't be run on the main thread, especially as they can block for multiple seconds at a time. Use threading!

  * Networking is physical and messy. Packets get lost in transit or get filtered, addresses, free ports and assigned mappings change, and devices may leave or join the network at any time. Be mindful of this, be diligent when checking and handling errors, and handle these gracefully if you can: add clear error UI, timeouts and re-try handling.

  * Port mappings may change (and be removed) at any time, and the remote/external IP address of the gateway can change likewise. You should consider re-querying the external IP and try to update/refresh the port mapping periodically (for example, every 5 minutes and on networking failures).

  * Not all devices support UPnP, and some users disable UPnP support. You need to handle this (e.g. documenting and requiring the user to manually forward ports, or adding alternative methods of NAT traversal, like a relay/mirror server, or NAT hole punching, STUN/TURN, etc.).

  * Consider what happens on mapping conflicts. Maybe multiple users on the same network would like to play your game at the same time, or maybe another application uses the same port. Make the port configurable, and optimally choose a port automatically (re-trying with a different port on failure).

Further reading: If you want to know more about UPnP (and the Internet Gateway
Device (IGD) and Port Control Protocol (PCP) specifically), Wikipedia is a
good first stop, the specification can be found at the Open Connectivity
Foundation and Godot's implementation is based on the MiniUPnP client.

didn't detect any valid UPNPDevices.

## Property Descriptions

bool discover_ipv6 = `false`

  * void set_discover_ipv6(value: bool)

  * bool is_discover_ipv6()

If `true`, IPv6 is used for UPNPDevice discovery.

int discover_local_port = `0`

  * void set_discover_local_port(value: int)

  * int get_discover_local_port()

If `0`, the local port to use for discovery is chosen automatically by the
system. If `1`, discovery will be done from the source port 1900 (same as
destination port). Otherwise, the value will be used as the port.

String discover_multicast_if = `""`

  * void set_discover_multicast_if(value: String)

  * String get_discover_multicast_if()

Multicast interface to use for discovery. Uses the default multicast interface
if empty.

## Method Descriptions

void add_device(device: UPNPDevice)

Adds the given UPNPDevice to the list of discovered devices.

int add_port_mapping(port: int, port_internal: int = 0, desc: String = "",
proto: String = "UDP", duration: int = 0) const

Adds a mapping to forward the external `port` (between 1 and 65535, although
recommended to use port 1024 or above) on the default gateway (see
get_gateway()) to the `port_internal` on the local machine for the given
protocol `proto` (either `"TCP"` or `"UDP"`, with UDP being the default). If a
port mapping for the given port and protocol combination already exists on
that gateway device, this method tries to overwrite it. If that is not
desired, you can retrieve the gateway manually with get_gateway() and call
add_port_mapping() on it, if any. Note that forwarding a well-known port
(below 1024) with UPnP may fail depending on the device.

Depending on the gateway device, if a mapping for that port already exists, it
will either be updated or it will refuse this command due to that conflict,
especially if the existing mapping for that port wasn't created via UPnP or
points to a different network address (or device) than this one.

If `port_internal` is `0` (the default), the same port number is used for both
the external and the internal port (the `port` value).

The description (`desc`) is shown in some routers management UIs and can be
used to point out which application added the mapping.

The mapping's lease `duration` can be limited by specifying a duration in
seconds. The default of `0` means no duration, i.e. a permanent lease and
notably some devices only support these permanent leases. Note that whether
permanent or not, this is only a request and the gateway may still decide at
any point to remove the mapping (which usually happens on a reboot of the
gateway, when its external IP address changes, or on some models when it
detects a port mapping has become inactive, i.e. had no traffic for multiple
minutes). If not `0` (permanent), the allowed range according to spec is
between `120` (2 minutes) and `86400` seconds (24 hours).

See UPNPResult for possible return values.

void clear_devices()

Clears the list of discovered devices.

int delete_port_mapping(port: int, proto: String = "UDP") const

Deletes the port mapping for the given port and protocol combination on the
default gateway (see get_gateway()) if one exists. `port` must be a valid port
between 1 and 65535, `proto` can be either `"TCP"` or `"UDP"`. May be refused
for mappings pointing to addresses other than this one, for well-known ports
(below 1024), or for mappings not added via UPnP. See UPNPResult for possible
return values.

int discover(timeout: int = 2000, ttl: int = 2, device_filter: String =
"InternetGatewayDevice")

Discovers local UPNPDevices. Clears the list of previously discovered devices.

Filters for IGD (InternetGatewayDevice) type devices by default, as those
manage port forwarding. `timeout` is the time to wait for responses in
milliseconds. `ttl` is the time-to-live; only touch this if you know what
you're doing.

See UPNPResult for possible return values.

UPNPDevice get_device(index: int) const

Returns the UPNPDevice at the given `index`.

int get_device_count() const

Returns the number of discovered UPNPDevices.

UPNPDevice get_gateway() const

Returns the default gateway. That is the first discovered UPNPDevice that is
also a valid IGD (InternetGatewayDevice).

String query_external_address() const

Returns the external IP address of the default gateway (see get_gateway()) as
string. Returns an empty string on error.

void remove_device(index: int)

Removes the device at `index` from the list of discovered devices.

void set_device(index: int, device: UPNPDevice)

Sets the device at `index` from the list of discovered devices to `device`.
