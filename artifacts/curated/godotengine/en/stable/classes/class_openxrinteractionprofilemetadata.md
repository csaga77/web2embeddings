# OpenXRInteractionProfileMetadata

Inherits: Object

Meta class registering supported devices in OpenXR.

## Description

This class allows OpenXR core and extensions to register metadata relating to
supported interaction devices such as controllers, trackers, haptic devices,
etc. It is primarily used by the action map editor and to sanitize any action
map by removing extension-dependent entries when applicable.

## Method Descriptions

void register_interaction_profile(display_name: String, openxr_path: String,
openxr_extension_name: String)

Registers an interaction profile using its OpenXR designation (e.g.
`/interaction_profiles/khr/simple_controller` is the profile for OpenXR's
simple controller profile).

`display_name` is the description shown to the user. `openxr_path` is the
interaction profile path being registered. `openxr_extension_name` optionally
restricts this profile to the given extension being enabled/available. If the
extension is not available, the profile and all related entries used in an
action map are filtered out.

void register_io_path(interaction_profile: String, display_name: String,
toplevel_path: String, openxr_path: String, openxr_extension_name: String,
action_type: ActionType)

Registers an input/output path for the given `interaction_profile`. The
profile should previously have been registered using
register_interaction_profile(). `display_name` is the description shown to the
user. `toplevel_path` specifies the bind path this input/output can be bound
to (e.g. `/user/hand/left` or `/user/hand/right`). `openxr_path` is the action
input/output being registered (e.g. `/user/hand/left/input/aim/pose`).
`openxr_extension_name` restricts this input/output to an enabled/available
extension, this doesn't need to repeat the extension on the profile but
relates to overlapping extension (e.g. `XR_EXT_palm_pose` that introduces
`/input/palm_ext/pose` input paths). `action_type` defines the type of input
or output provided by OpenXR.

void register_profile_rename(old_name: String, new_name: String)

Allows for renaming old interaction profile paths to new paths to maintain
backwards compatibility with older action maps.

void register_top_level_path(display_name: String, openxr_path: String,
openxr_extension_name: String)

Registers a top level path to which profiles can be bound. For instance
`/user/hand/left` refers to the bind point for the player's left hand.
Extensions can register additional top level paths, for instance a haptic vest
extension might register `/user/body/vest`.

`display_name` is the name shown to the user. `openxr_path` is the top level
path being registered. `openxr_extension_name` is optional and ensures the top
level path is only used if the specified extension is available/enabled.

When a top level path ends up being bound by OpenXR, a XRPositionalTracker is
instantiated to manage the state of the device.
