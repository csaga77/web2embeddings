# SegmentShape2D

Inherits: Shape2D < Resource < RefCounted < Object

A 2D line segment shape used for physics collision.

## Description

A 2D line segment shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide
a shape for a CollisionShape2D.

## Properties

Vector2 | a | `Vector2(0, 0)`  
---|---|---  
Vector2 | b | `Vector2(0, 10)`  
  
## Property Descriptions

Vector2 a = `Vector2(0, 0)`

  * void set_a(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_a()

The segment's first point position.

Vector2 b = `Vector2(0, 10)`

  * void set_b(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_b()

The segment's second point position.
