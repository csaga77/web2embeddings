A box-shaped 3D particle collision shape affecting GPUParticles3D nodes.

## Description

A box-shaped 3D particle collision shape affecting GPUParticles3D nodes.

Particle collision shapes work in real-time and can be moved, rotated and
scaled during gameplay. Unlike attractors, non-uniform scaling of collision
shapes is not supported.

Note: ParticleProcessMaterial.collision_mode must be
ParticleProcessMaterial.COLLISION_RIGID or
ParticleProcessMaterial.COLLISION_HIDE_ON_CONTACT on the GPUParticles3D's
process material for collision to work.

Note: Particle collision only affects GPUParticles3D, not CPUParticles3D.

## Properties

Vector3 | size | `Vector3(2, 2, 2)`  
---|---|---  
  
## Property Descriptions

Vector3 size = `Vector3(2, 2, 2)`

  * void set_size(value: Vector3)

  * Vector3 get_size()

The collision box's size in 3D units.
