# VisualShaderNodeFaceForward

Inherits: VisualShaderNodeVectorBase < VisualShaderNode < Resource <
RefCounted < Object

Returns the vector that points in the same direction as a reference vector
within the visual shader graph.

## Description

Translates to `faceforward(N, I, Nref)` in the shader language. The function
has three vector parameters: `N`, the vector to orient, `I`, the incident
vector, and `Nref`, the reference vector. If the dot product of `I` and `Nref`
is smaller than zero the return value is `N`. Otherwise, `-N` is returned.
