# CanvasItemMaterial

Inherits: Material < Resource < RefCounted < Object

A material for CanvasItems.

## Description

CanvasItemMaterials provide a means of modifying the textures associated with
a CanvasItem. They specialize in describing blend and lighting behaviors for
textures. Use a ShaderMaterial to more fully customize a material's
interactions with a CanvasItem.

## Properties

BlendMode | blend_mode | `0`  
---|---|---  
LightMode | light_mode | `0`  
int | particles_anim_h_frames  
bool | particles_anim_loop  
int | particles_anim_v_frames  
bool | particles_animation | `false`  
  
## Enumerations

enum BlendMode:

BlendMode BLEND_MODE_MIX = `0`

Mix blending mode. Colors are assumed to be independent of the alpha (opacity)
value.

BlendMode BLEND_MODE_ADD = `1`

Additive blending mode.

BlendMode BLEND_MODE_SUB = `2`

Subtractive blending mode.

BlendMode BLEND_MODE_MUL = `3`

Multiplicative blending mode.

BlendMode BLEND_MODE_PREMULT_ALPHA = `4`

Mix blending mode. Colors are assumed to be premultiplied by the alpha
(opacity) value.

enum LightMode:

LightMode LIGHT_MODE_NORMAL = `0`

Render the material using both light and non-light sensitive material
properties.

LightMode LIGHT_MODE_UNSHADED = `1`

Render the material as if there were no light.

LightMode LIGHT_MODE_LIGHT_ONLY = `2`

Render the material as if there were only light.

## Property Descriptions

BlendMode blend_mode = `0`

  * void set_blend_mode(value: BlendMode)

  * BlendMode get_blend_mode()

The manner in which a material's rendering is applied to underlying textures.

LightMode light_mode = `0`

  * void set_light_mode(value: LightMode)

  * LightMode get_light_mode()

The manner in which material reacts to lighting.

int particles_anim_h_frames

  * void set_particles_anim_h_frames(value: int)

  * int get_particles_anim_h_frames()

The number of columns in the spritesheet assigned as Texture2D for a
GPUParticles2D or CPUParticles2D.

Note: This property is only used and visible in the editor if
particles_animation is `true`.

bool particles_anim_loop

  * void set_particles_anim_loop(value: bool)

  * bool get_particles_anim_loop()

If `true`, the particles animation will loop.

Note: This property is only used and visible in the editor if
particles_animation is `true`.

int particles_anim_v_frames

  * void set_particles_anim_v_frames(value: int)

  * int get_particles_anim_v_frames()

The number of rows in the spritesheet assigned as Texture2D for a
GPUParticles2D or CPUParticles2D.

Note: This property is only used and visible in the editor if
particles_animation is `true`.

bool particles_animation = `false`

  * void set_particles_animation(value: bool)

  * bool get_particles_animation()

If `true`, enable spritesheet-based animation features when assigned to
GPUParticles2D and CPUParticles2D nodes. The
ParticleProcessMaterial.anim_speed_max or CPUParticles2D.anim_speed_max should
also be set to a positive value for the animation to play.

This property (and other `particles_anim_*` properties that depend on it) has
no effect on other types of nodes.
