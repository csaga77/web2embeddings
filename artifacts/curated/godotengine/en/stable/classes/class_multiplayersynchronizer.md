# MultiplayerSynchronizer

Inherits: Node < Object

Synchronizes properties from the multiplayer authority to the remote peers.

## Description

By default, MultiplayerSynchronizer synchronizes configured properties to all
peers.

Visibility can be handled directly with set_visibility_for() or as-needed with
add_visibility_filter() and update_visibility().

MultiplayerSpawners will handle nodes according to visibility of synchronizers
as long as the node at root_path was spawned by one.

Internally, MultiplayerSynchronizer uses
MultiplayerAPI.object_configuration_add() to notify synchronization start
passing the Node at root_path as the `object` and itself as the
`configuration`, and uses MultiplayerAPI.object_configuration_remove() to
notify synchronization end in a similar way.

Note: Synchronization is not supported for Object type properties, like
Resource. Properties that are unique to each peer, like the instance IDs of
Objects (see Object.get_instance_id()) or RIDs, will also not work in
synchronization.

## Properties

float | delta_interval | `0.0`  
---|---|---  
bool | public_visibility | `true`  
SceneReplicationConfig | replication_config  
float | replication_interval | `0.0`  
NodePath | root_path | `NodePath("..")`  
VisibilityUpdateMode | visibility_update_mode | `0`  
  
## Methods

void | add_visibility_filter(filter: Callable)  
---|---  
bool | get_visibility_for(peer: int) const  
void | remove_visibility_filter(filter: Callable)  
void | set_visibility_for(peer: int, visible: bool)  
void | update_visibility(for_peer: int = 0)  
  
## Signals

delta_synchronized()

Emitted when a new delta synchronization state is received by this
synchronizer after the properties have been updated.

synchronized()

Emitted when a new synchronization state is received by this synchronizer
after the properties have been updated.

visibility_changed(for_peer: int)

Emitted when visibility of `for_peer` is updated. See update_visibility().

## Enumerations

enum VisibilityUpdateMode:

VisibilityUpdateMode VISIBILITY_PROCESS_IDLE = `0`

Visibility filters are updated during process frames (see
Node.NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_PROCESS).

VisibilityUpdateMode VISIBILITY_PROCESS_PHYSICS = `1`

Visibility filters are updated during physics frames (see
Node.NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_PHYSICS_PROCESS).

VisibilityUpdateMode VISIBILITY_PROCESS_NONE = `2`

Visibility filters are not updated automatically, and must be updated manually
by calling update_visibility().

## Property Descriptions

float delta_interval = `0.0`

  * void set_delta_interval(value: float)

  * float get_delta_interval()

Time interval between delta synchronizations. Used when the replication is set
to SceneReplicationConfig.REPLICATION_MODE_ON_CHANGE. If set to `0.0` (the
default), delta synchronizations happen every network process frame.

bool public_visibility = `true`

  * void set_visibility_public(value: bool)

  * bool is_visibility_public()

Whether synchronization should be visible to all peers by default. See
set_visibility_for() and add_visibility_filter() for ways of configuring fine-
grained visibility options.

SceneReplicationConfig replication_config

  * void set_replication_config(value: SceneReplicationConfig)

  * SceneReplicationConfig get_replication_config()

Resource containing which properties to synchronize.

float replication_interval = `0.0`

  * void set_replication_interval(value: float)

  * float get_replication_interval()

Time interval between synchronizations. Used when the replication is set to
SceneReplicationConfig.REPLICATION_MODE_ALWAYS. If set to `0.0` (the default),
synchronizations happen every network process frame.

NodePath root_path = `NodePath("..")`

  * void set_root_path(value: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_root_path()

Node path that replicated properties are relative to.

If root_path was spawned by a MultiplayerSpawner, the node will be also be
spawned and despawned based on this synchronizer visibility options.

VisibilityUpdateMode visibility_update_mode = `0`

  * void set_visibility_update_mode(value: VisibilityUpdateMode)

  * VisibilityUpdateMode get_visibility_update_mode()

Specifies when visibility filters are updated (see VisibilityUpdateMode for
options).

## Method Descriptions

void add_visibility_filter(filter: Callable)

Adds a peer visibility filter for this synchronizer.

`filter` should take a peer ID int and return a bool.

bool get_visibility_for(peer: int) const

Queries the current visibility for peer `peer`.

void remove_visibility_filter(filter: Callable)

Removes a peer visibility filter from this synchronizer.

void set_visibility_for(peer: int, visible: bool)

Sets the visibility of `peer` to `visible`. If `peer` is `0`, the value of
public_visibility will be updated instead.

void update_visibility(for_peer: int = 0)

Updates the visibility of `for_peer` according to visibility filters. If
`for_peer` is `0` (the default), all peers' visibilties are updated.
