## Constants

DEVICE_ID_EMULATION = `-1`

Device ID used for emulated mouse input from a touchscreen, or for emulated
touch input from a mouse. This can be used to distinguish emulated mouse input
from physical mouse input, or emulated touch input from physical touch input.

## Property Descriptions

int device = `0`

  * void set_device(value: int)

  * int get_device()

The event's device ID.

Note: device can be negative for special use cases that don't refer to devices
physically present on the system. See DEVICE_ID_EMULATION.

## Method Descriptions

bool accumulate(with_event: InputEvent)

Returns `true` if the given input event and this input event can be added
together (only for events of type InputEventMouseMotion).

The given input event's position, global position and speed will be copied.
The resulting `relative` is a sum of both events. Both events' modifiers have
to be identical.

String as_text() const

Returns a String representation of the event.

float get_action_strength(action: StringName, exact_match: bool = false) const

Returns a value between 0.0 and 1.0 depending on the given actions' state.
Useful for getting the value of events of type InputEventJoypadMotion.

If `exact_match` is `false`, it ignores additional input modifiers for
InputEventKey and InputEventMouseButton events, and the direction for
InputEventJoypadMotion events.

bool is_action(action: StringName, exact_match: bool = false) const

Returns `true` if this input event matches a pre-defined action of any type.

If `exact_match` is `false`, it ignores additional input modifiers for
InputEventKey and InputEventMouseButton events, and the direction for
InputEventJoypadMotion events.

bool is_action_pressed(action: StringName, allow_echo: bool = false,
exact_match: bool = false) const

Returns `true` if the given action is being pressed (and is not an echo event
for InputEventKey events, unless `allow_echo` is `true`). Not relevant for
events of type InputEventMouseMotion or InputEventScreenDrag.

If `exact_match` is `false`, it ignores additional input modifiers for
InputEventKey and InputEventMouseButton events, and the direction for
InputEventJoypadMotion events.

Note: Due to keyboard ghosting, is_action_pressed() may return `false` even if
one of the action's keys is pressed. See Input examples in the documentation
for more information.

bool is_action_released(action: StringName, exact_match: bool = false) const

Returns `true` if the given action is released (i.e. not pressed). Not
relevant for events of type InputEventMouseMotion or InputEventScreenDrag.

If `exact_match` is `false`, it ignores additional input modifiers for
InputEventKey and InputEventMouseButton events, and the direction for
InputEventJoypadMotion events.

bool is_action_type() const

Returns `true` if this input event's type is one that can be assigned to an
input action.

bool is_canceled() const

Returns `true` if this input event has been canceled.

bool is_echo() const

Returns `true` if this input event is an echo event (only for events of type
InputEventKey). An echo event is a repeated key event sent when the user is
holding down the key. Any other event type returns `false`.

Note: The rate at which echo events are sent is typically around 20 events per
second (after holding down the key for roughly half a second). However, the
key repeat delay/speed can be changed by the user or disabled entirely in the
operating system settings. To ensure your project works correctly on all
configurations, do not assume the user has a specific key repeat configuration
in your project's behavior.

bool is_match(event: InputEvent, exact_match: bool = true) const

Returns `true` if the specified `event` matches this event. Only valid for
action events i.e key (InputEventKey), button (InputEventMouseButton or
InputEventJoypadButton), axis InputEventJoypadMotion or action
(InputEventAction) events.

If `exact_match` is `false`, it ignores additional input modifiers for
InputEventKey and InputEventMouseButton events, and the direction for
InputEventJoypadMotion events.

Note: Only considers the event configuration (such as the keyboard key or
joypad axis), not state information like is_pressed(), is_released(),
is_echo(), or is_canceled().

bool is_pressed() const

Returns `true` if this input event is pressed. Not relevant for events of type
InputEventMouseMotion or InputEventScreenDrag.

Note: Due to keyboard ghosting, is_pressed() may return `false` even if one of
the action's keys is pressed. See Input examples in the documentation for more
information.

bool is_released() const

Returns `true` if this input event is released. Not relevant for events of
type InputEventMouseMotion or InputEventScreenDrag.

InputEvent xformed_by(xform: Transform2D, local_ofs: Vector2 = Vector2(0, 0))
const

Returns a copy of the given input event which has been offset by `local_ofs`
and transformed by `xform`. Relevant for events of type InputEventMouseButton,
InputEventMouseMotion, InputEventScreenTouch, InputEventScreenDrag,
InputEventMagnifyGesture and InputEventPanGesture.
