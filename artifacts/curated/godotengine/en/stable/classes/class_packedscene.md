# PackedScene

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

An abstraction of a serialized scene.

## Description

A simplified interface to a scene file. Provides access to operations and
checks that can be performed on the scene resource itself.

Can be used to save a node to a file. When saving, the node as well as all the
nodes it owns get saved (see Node.owner property).

Note: The node doesn't need to own itself.

Example: Load a saved scene:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    # Use load() instead of preload() if the path isn't known at compile-time.
    var scene = preload("res://scene.tscn").instantiate()
    # Add the node as a child of the node the script is attached to.
    add_child(scene)
    
    
    
    // C# has no preload, so you have to always use ResourceLoader.Load<PackedScene>().
    var scene = ResourceLoader.Load<PackedScene>("res://scene.tscn").Instantiate();
    // Add the node as a child of the node the script is attached to.
    AddChild(scene);
    

Example: Save a node with different owners. The following example creates 3
objects: Node2D (`node`), RigidBody2D (`body`) and CollisionObject2D
(`collision`). `collision` is a child of `body` which is a child of `node`.
Only `body` is owned by `node` and pack() will therefore only save those two
nodes, but not `collision`.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    # Create the objects.
    var node = Node2D.new()
    var body = RigidBody2D.new()
    var collision = CollisionShape2D.new()
    
    # Create the object hierarchy.
    body.add_child(collision)
    node.add_child(body)
    
    # Change owner of `body`, but not of `collision`.
    body.owner = node
    var scene = PackedScene.new()
    
    # Only `node` and `body` are now packed.
    var result = scene.pack(node)
    if result == OK:
        var error = ResourceSaver.save(scene, "res://path/name.tscn")  # Or "user://..."
        if error != OK:
            push_error("An error occurred while saving the scene to disk.")
    
    
    
    // Create the objects.
    var node = new Node2D();
    var body = new RigidBody2D();
    var collision = new CollisionShape2D();
    
    // Create the object hierarchy.
    body.AddChild(collision);
    node.AddChild(body);
    
    // Change owner of `body`, but not of `collision`.
    body.Owner = node;
    var scene = new PackedScene();
    
    // Only `node` and `body` are now packed.
    Error result = scene.Pack(node);
    if (result == Error.Ok)
    {
        Error error = ResourceSaver.Save(scene, "res://path/name.tscn"); // Or "user://..."
        if (error != Error.Ok)
        {
            GD.PushError("An error occurred while saving the scene to disk.");
        }
    }

## Methods

bool | can_instantiate() const  
---|---  
SceneState | get_state() const  
Node | instantiate(edit_state: GenEditState = 0) const  
Error | pack(path: Node)  
  
## Enumerations

enum GenEditState:

GenEditState GEN_EDIT_STATE_DISABLED = `0`

If passed to instantiate(), blocks edits to the scene state.

GenEditState GEN_EDIT_STATE_INSTANCE = `1`

If passed to instantiate(), provides local scene resources to the local scene.

Note: Only available in editor builds.

GenEditState GEN_EDIT_STATE_MAIN = `2`

If passed to instantiate(), provides local scene resources to the local scene.
Only the main scene should receive the main edit state.

Note: Only available in editor builds.

GenEditState GEN_EDIT_STATE_MAIN_INHERITED = `3`

It's similar to GEN_EDIT_STATE_MAIN, but for the case where the scene is being
instantiated to be the base of another one.

Note: Only available in editor builds.

## Method Descriptions

bool can_instantiate() const

Returns `true` if the scene file has nodes.

SceneState get_state() const

Returns the SceneState representing the scene file contents.

Node instantiate(edit_state: GenEditState = 0) const

Instantiates the scene's node hierarchy. Triggers child scene
instantiation(s). Triggers a Node.NOTIFICATION_SCENE_INSTANTIATED notification
on the root node.

Error pack(path: Node)

Packs the `path` node, and all owned sub-nodes, into this PackedScene. Any
existing data will be cleared. See Node.owner.
