# Image

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

Image datatype.

## Description

Native image datatype. Contains image data which can be converted to an
ImageTexture and provides commonly used image processing methods. The maximum
width and height for an Image are MAX_WIDTH and MAX_HEIGHT.

An Image cannot be assigned to a texture property of an object directly (such
as Sprite2D.texture), and has to be converted manually to an ImageTexture
first.

Note: The maximum image size is 1638416384 pixels due to graphics hardware
limitations. Larger images may fail to import.

Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression. This implements the 44 (high quality)
mode.

Format FORMAT_ASTC_4x4_HDR = `36`

Same format as FORMAT_ASTC_4x4, but with the hint to let the GPU know it is
used for HDR.

Format FORMAT_ASTC_8x8 = `37`

Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression. This implements the 88 (low quality)

Format FORMAT_MAX = `39`

Represents the size of the Format enum.

enum Interpolation:

Interpolation INTERPOLATE_NEAREST = `0`

Performs nearest-neighbor interpolation. If the image is resized, it will be
pixelated.

Interpolation INTERPOLATE_BILINEAR = `1`

Performs bilinear interpolation. If the image is resized, it will be blurry.
This mode is faster than INTERPOLATE_CUBIC, but it results in lower quality.

Interpolation INTERPOLATE_CUBIC = `2`

Performs cubic interpolation. If the image is resized, it will be blurry. This
mode often gives better results compared to INTERPOLATE_BILINEAR, at the cost
of being slower.

Interpolation INTERPOLATE_TRILINEAR = `3`

Performs bilinear separately on the two most-suited mipmap levels, then
linearly interpolates between them.

It's slower than INTERPOLATE_BILINEAR, but produces higher-quality results
with far fewer aliasing artifacts.

If the image does not have mipmaps, they will be generated and used
internally, but no mipmaps will be generated on the resulting image.

Note: If you intend to scale multiple copies of the original image, it's
better to call generate_mipmaps()] on it in advance, to avoid wasting
processing power in generating them again and again.

On the other hand, if the image already has mipmaps, they will be used, and a
new set will be generated for the resulting image.

Interpolation INTERPOLATE_LANCZOS = `4`

Performs Lanczos interpolation. This is the slowest image resizing mode, but
it typically gives the best results, especially when downscaling images.

enum AlphaMode:

AlphaMode ALPHA_NONE = `0`

Image does not have alpha.

AlphaMode ALPHA_BIT = `1`

Image stores alpha in a single bit.

AlphaMode ALPHA_BLEND = `2`

Source texture (before compression) is a regular texture. Default for all
textures.

CompressSource COMPRESS_SOURCE_SRGB = `1`

Source texture (before compression) is in sRGB space.

CompressSource COMPRESS_SOURCE_NORMAL = `2`

Source texture (before compression) is a normal texture (e.g. it can be
compressed into two channels).

ASTCFormat ASTC_FORMAT_4x4 = `0`

Hint to indicate that the high quality 44 ASTC compression format should be
used.

ASTCFormat ASTC_FORMAT_8x8 = `1`

used.

## Constants

MAX_WIDTH = `16777216`

The maximal width allowed for Image resources.

MAX_HEIGHT = `16777216`

The maximal height allowed for Image resources.

## Property Descriptions

Dictionary data = `{ "data": PackedByteArray(), "format": "Lum8", "height": 0,
"mipmaps": false, "width": 0 }`

Holds all the image's color data in a given format. See Format constants.

## Method Descriptions

void adjust_bcs(brightness: float, contrast: float, saturation: float)

Adjusts this image's `brightness`, `contrast`, and `saturation` by the given
values. Does not work if the image is compressed (see is_compressed()).

void blend_rect(src: Image, src_rect: Rect2i, dst: Vector2i)

Alpha-blends `src_rect` from `src` image to this image at coordinates `dst`,
clipped accordingly to both image bounds. This image and `src` image must have
the same format. `src_rect` with non-positive size is treated as empty.

void blend_rect_mask(src: Image, mask: Image, src_rect: Rect2i, dst: Vector2i)

Alpha-blends `src_rect` from `src` image to this image using `mask` image at
coordinates `dst`, clipped accordingly to both image bounds. Alpha channels
are required for both `src` and `mask`. `dst` pixels and `src` pixels will
blend if the corresponding mask pixel's alpha value is not 0. This image and
`src` image must have the same format. `src` image and `mask` image must have
the same size (width and height) but they can have different formats.
`src_rect` with non-positive size is treated as empty.

void blit_rect(src: Image, src_rect: Rect2i, dst: Vector2i)

Copies `src_rect` from `src` image to this image at coordinates `dst`, clipped
accordingly to both image bounds. This image and `src` image must have the
same format. `src_rect` with non-positive size is treated as empty.

Note: The alpha channel data in `src` will overwrite the corresponding data in
this image at the target position. To blend alpha channels, use blend_rect()
instead.

void blit_rect_mask(src: Image, mask: Image, src_rect: Rect2i, dst: Vector2i)

Blits `src_rect` area from `src` image to this image at the coordinates given
by `dst`, clipped accordingly to both image bounds. `src` pixel is copied onto
`dst` if the corresponding `mask` pixel's alpha value is not 0. This image and
`src` image must have the same format. `src` image and `mask` image must have
the same size (width and height) but they can have different formats.
`src_rect` with non-positive size is treated as empty.

void bump_map_to_normal_map(bump_scale: float = 1.0)

Converts a bump map to a normal map. A bump map provides a height offset per-
pixel, while a normal map provides a normal direction per pixel.

void clear_mipmaps()

Removes the image's mipmaps.

Error compress(mode: CompressMode, source: CompressSource = 0, astc_format:
ASTCFormat = 0)

Compresses the image to use less memory. Can not directly access pixel data
while the image is compressed. Returns error if the chosen compression mode is
not available.

The `source` parameter helps to pick the best compression method for DXT and
ETC2 formats. It is ignored for ASTC compression.

For ASTC compression, the `astc_format` parameter must be supplied.

Error compress_from_channels(mode: CompressMode, channels: UsedChannels,
astc_format: ASTCFormat = 0)

Compresses the image to use less memory. Can not directly access pixel data
while the image is compressed. Returns error if the chosen compression mode is
not available.

This is an alternative to compress() that lets the user supply the channels
used in order for the compressor to pick the best DXT and ETC2 formats. For
other formats (non DXT or ETC2), this argument is ignored.

For ASTC compression, the `astc_format` parameter must be supplied.

Dictionary compute_image_metrics(compared_image: Image, use_luma: bool)

Compute image metrics on the current image and the compared image.

The dictionary contains `max`, `mean`, `mean_squared`, `root_mean_squared` and
`peak_snr`.

void convert(format: Format)

Converts the image's format. See Format constants.

void copy_from(src: Image)

Copies `src` image to this image.

Image create(width: int, height: int, use_mipmaps: bool, format: Format)
static

Deprecated: Use create_empty().

Creates an empty image of given size and format. See Format constants. If
`use_mipmaps` is `true`, then generate mipmaps for this image. See the
generate_mipmaps().

Image create_empty(width: int, height: int, use_mipmaps: bool, format: Format)
static

Creates an empty image of given size and format. See Format constants. If
`use_mipmaps` is `true`, then generate mipmaps for this image. See the
generate_mipmaps().

Image create_from_data(width: int, height: int, use_mipmaps: bool, format:
Format, data: PackedByteArray) static

Creates a new image of given size and format. See Format constants. Fills the
image with the given raw data. If `use_mipmaps` is `true` then loads mipmaps
for this image from `data`. See generate_mipmaps().

void crop(width: int, height: int)

Crops the image to the given `width` and `height`. If the specified size is
larger than the current size, the extra area is filled with black pixels.

Error decompress()

Decompresses the image if it is VRAM compressed in a supported format. Returns
@GlobalScope.OK if the format is supported, otherwise
@GlobalScope.ERR_UNAVAILABLE.

Note: The following formats can be decompressed: DXT, RGTC, BPTC. The formats
ETC1 and ETC2 are not supported.

AlphaMode detect_alpha() const

Returns ALPHA_BLEND if the image has data for alpha values. Returns ALPHA_BIT
if all the alpha values are stored in a single bit. Returns ALPHA_NONE if no
data for alpha values is found.

UsedChannels detect_used_channels(source: CompressSource = 0) const

Returns the color channels used by this image, as one of the UsedChannels
constants. If the image is compressed, the original `source` must be
specified.

void fill(color: Color)

Fills the image with `color`.

void fill_rect(rect: Rect2i, color: Color)

Fills `rect` with `color`.

void fix_alpha_edges()

Blends low-alpha pixels with nearby pixels.

void flip_x()

Flips the image horizontally.

void flip_y()

Flips the image vertically.

Error generate_mipmaps(renormalize: bool = false)

Generates mipmaps for the image. Mipmaps are precalculated lower-resolution
copies of the image that are automatically used if the image needs to be
scaled down when rendered. They help improve image quality and performance
when rendering. This method returns an error if the image is compressed, in a
custom format, or if the image's width/height is `0`. Enabling `renormalize`
when generating mipmaps for normal map textures will make sure all resulting
vector values are normalized.

It is possible to check if the image has mipmaps by calling has_mipmaps() or
get_mipmap_count(). Calling generate_mipmaps() on an image that already has
mipmaps will replace existing mipmaps in the image.

PackedByteArray get_data() const

Returns a copy of the image's raw data.

int get_data_size() const

Returns size (in bytes) of the image's raw data.

Format get_format() const

Returns the image's format. See Format constants.

int get_height() const

Returns the image's height.

int get_mipmap_count() const

Returns the number of mipmap levels or 0 if the image has no mipmaps. The
largest main level image is not counted as a mipmap level by this method, so
if you want to include it you can add 1 to this count.

int get_mipmap_offset(mipmap: int) const

Returns the offset where the image's mipmap with index `mipmap` is stored in
the data dictionary.

Color get_pixel(x: int, y: int) const

Returns the color of the pixel at `(x, y)`.

This is the same as get_pixelv(), but with two integer arguments instead of a
Vector2i argument.

Color get_pixelv(point: Vector2i) const

Returns the color of the pixel at `point`.

This is the same as get_pixel(), but with a Vector2i argument instead of two
integer arguments.

Image get_region(region: Rect2i) const

Returns a new Image that is a copy of this Image's area specified with
`region`.

Vector2i get_size() const

Returns the image's size (width and height).

Rect2i get_used_rect() const

Returns a Rect2i enclosing the visible portion of the image, considering each
pixel with a non-zero alpha channel as visible.

int get_width() const

Returns the image's width.

bool has_mipmaps() const

Returns `true` if the image has generated mipmaps.

bool is_compressed() const

Returns `true` if the image is compressed.

bool is_empty() const

Returns `true` if the image has no data.

bool is_invisible() const

Returns `true` if all the image's pixels have an alpha value of 0. Returns
`false` if any pixel has an alpha value higher than 0.

void linear_to_srgb()

Converts the entire image from the linear colorspace to the sRGB colorspace.
Only works on images with FORMAT_RGB8 or FORMAT_RGBA8 formats.

Error load(path: String)

Loads an image from file `path`. See Supported image formats for a list of
supported image formats and limitations.

Warning: This method should only be used in the editor or in cases when you
need to load external images at run-time, such as images located at the
`user://` directory, and may not work in exported projects.

See also ImageTexture description for usage examples.

Error load_bmp_from_buffer(buffer: PackedByteArray)

Loads an image from the binary contents of a BMP file.

Note: Godot's BMP module doesn't support 16-bit per pixel images. Only 1-bit,
4-bit, 8-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit per pixel images are supported.

Note: This method is only available in engine builds with the BMP module
enabled. By default, the BMP module is enabled, but it can be disabled at
build-time using the `module_bmp_enabled=no` SCons option.

Image load_from_file(path: String) static

Creates a new Image and loads data from the specified file.

Error load_jpg_from_buffer(buffer: PackedByteArray)

Loads an image from the binary contents of a JPEG file.

Error load_ktx_from_buffer(buffer: PackedByteArray)

Loads an image from the binary contents of a KTX file. Unlike most image
formats, KTX can store VRAM-compressed data and embed mipmaps.

Note: Godot's libktx implementation only supports 2D images. Cubemaps, texture
arrays, and de-padding are not supported.

Note: This method is only available in engine builds with the KTX module
enabled. By default, the KTX module is enabled, but it can be disabled at
build-time using the `module_ktx_enabled=no` SCons option.

Error load_png_from_buffer(buffer: PackedByteArray)

Loads an image from the binary contents of a PNG file.

Error load_svg_from_buffer(buffer: PackedByteArray, scale: float = 1.0)

Loads an image from the UTF-8 binary contents of an uncompressed SVG file
(.svg).

Note: Beware when using compressed SVG files (like .svgz), they need to be
`decompressed` before loading.

Note: This method is only available in engine builds with the SVG module
enabled. By default, the SVG module is enabled, but it can be disabled at
build-time using the `module_svg_enabled=no` SCons option.

Error load_svg_from_string(svg_str: String, scale: float = 1.0)

Loads an image from the string contents of an SVG file (.svg).

Note: This method is only available in engine builds with the SVG module
enabled. By default, the SVG module is enabled, but it can be disabled at
build-time using the `module_svg_enabled=no` SCons option.

Error load_tga_from_buffer(buffer: PackedByteArray)

Loads an image from the binary contents of a TGA file.

Note: This method is only available in engine builds with the TGA module
enabled. By default, the TGA module is enabled, but it can be disabled at
build-time using the `module_tga_enabled=no` SCons option.

Error load_webp_from_buffer(buffer: PackedByteArray)

Loads an image from the binary contents of a WebP file.

void normal_map_to_xy()

Converts the image's data to represent coordinates on a 3D plane. This is used
when the image represents a normal map. A normal map can add lots of detail to
a 3D surface without increasing the polygon count.

void premultiply_alpha()

Multiplies color values with alpha values. Resulting color values for a pixel
are `(color * alpha)/256`. See also CanvasItemMaterial.blend_mode.

void resize(width: int, height: int, interpolation: Interpolation = 1)

Resizes the image to the given `width` and `height`. New pixels are calculated
using the `interpolation` mode defined via Interpolation constants.

void resize_to_po2(square: bool = false, interpolation: Interpolation = 1)

Resizes the image to the nearest power of 2 for the width and height. If
`square` is `true` then set width and height to be the same. New pixels are
calculated using the `interpolation` mode defined via Interpolation constants.

Image rgbe_to_srgb()

Converts a standard RGBE (Red Green Blue Exponent) image to an sRGB image.

void rotate_90(direction: ClockDirection)

Rotates the image in the specified `direction` by `90` degrees. The width and
height of the image must be greater than `1`. If the width and height are not
equal, the image will be resized.

void rotate_180()

Rotates the image by `180` degrees. The width and height of the image must be
greater than `1`.

Error save_exr(path: String, grayscale: bool = false) const

Saves the image as an EXR file to `path`. If `grayscale` is `true` and the
image has only one channel, it will be saved explicitly as monochrome rather
than one red channel. This function will return @GlobalScope.ERR_UNAVAILABLE
if Godot was compiled without the TinyEXR module.

Note: The TinyEXR module is disabled in non-editor builds, which means
save_exr() will return @GlobalScope.ERR_UNAVAILABLE when it is called from an
exported project.

PackedByteArray save_exr_to_buffer(grayscale: bool = false) const

Saves the image as an EXR file to a byte array. If `grayscale` is `true` and
the image has only one channel, it will be saved explicitly as monochrome
rather than one red channel. This function will return an empty byte array if
Godot was compiled without the TinyEXR module.

Note: The TinyEXR module is disabled in non-editor builds, which means
save_exr() will return an empty byte array when it is called from an exported
project.

Error save_jpg(path: String, quality: float = 0.75) const

Saves the image as a JPEG file to `path` with the specified `quality` between
`0.01` and `1.0` (inclusive). Higher `quality` values result in better-looking
output at the cost of larger file sizes. Recommended `quality` values are
between `0.75` and `0.90`. Even at quality `1.00`, JPEG compression remains
lossy.

Note: JPEG does not save an alpha channel. If the Image contains an alpha
channel, the image will still be saved, but the resulting JPEG file won't
contain the alpha channel.

PackedByteArray save_jpg_to_buffer(quality: float = 0.75) const

Saves the image as a JPEG file to a byte array with the specified `quality`
between `0.01` and `1.0` (inclusive). Higher `quality` values result in
better-looking output at the cost of larger byte array sizes (and therefore
memory usage). Recommended `quality` values are between `0.75` and `0.90`.
Even at quality `1.00`, JPEG compression remains lossy.

Note: JPEG does not save an alpha channel. If the Image contains an alpha
channel, the image will still be saved, but the resulting byte array won't
contain the alpha channel.

Error save_png(path: String) const

Saves the image as a PNG file to the file at `path`.

PackedByteArray save_png_to_buffer() const

Saves the image as a PNG file to a byte array.

Error save_webp(path: String, lossy: bool = false, quality: float = 0.75)
const

Saves the image as a WebP (Web Picture) file to the file at `path`. By default
it will save lossless. If `lossy` is `true`, the image will be saved lossy,
using the `quality` setting between `0.0` and `1.0` (inclusive). Lossless WebP
offers more efficient compression than PNG.

Note: The WebP format is limited to a size of 1638316383 pixels, while PNG can
save larger images.

PackedByteArray save_webp_to_buffer(lossy: bool = false, quality: float =
0.75) const

Saves the image as a WebP (Web Picture) file to a byte array. By default it
will save lossless. If `lossy` is `true`, the image will be saved lossy, using
the `quality` setting between `0.0` and `1.0` (inclusive). Lossless WebP
offers more efficient compression than PNG.

Note: The WebP format is limited to a size of 1638316383 pixels, while PNG can
save larger images.

void set_data(width: int, height: int, use_mipmaps: bool, format: Format,
data: PackedByteArray)

Overwrites data of an existing Image. Non-static equivalent of
create_from_data().

void set_pixel(x: int, y: int, color: Color)

Sets the Color of the pixel at `(x, y)` to `color`.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    var img_width = 10
    var img_height = 5
    var img = Image.create(img_width, img_height, false, Image.FORMAT_RGBA8)
    
    img.set_pixel(1, 2, Color.RED) # Sets the color at (1, 2) to red.
    
    
    
    int imgWidth = 10;
    int imgHeight = 5;
    var img = Image.Create(imgWidth, imgHeight, false, Image.Format.Rgba8);
    
    img.SetPixel(1, 2, Colors.Red); // Sets the color at (1, 2) to red.
    

This is the same as set_pixelv(), but with a two integer arguments instead of
a Vector2i argument.

void set_pixelv(point: Vector2i, color: Color)

Sets the Color of the pixel at `point` to `color`.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    var img_width = 10
    var img_height = 5
    var img = Image.create(img_width, img_height, false, Image.FORMAT_RGBA8)
    
    img.set_pixelv(Vector2i(1, 2), Color.RED) # Sets the color at (1, 2) to red.
    
    
    
    int imgWidth = 10;
    int imgHeight = 5;
    var img = Image.Create(imgWidth, imgHeight, false, Image.Format.Rgba8);
    
    img.SetPixelv(new Vector2I(1, 2), Colors.Red); // Sets the color at (1, 2) to red.
    

This is the same as set_pixel(), but with a Vector2i argument instead of two
integer arguments.

void shrink_x2()

Shrinks the image by a factor of 2 on each axis (this divides the pixel count
by 4).

void srgb_to_linear()

Converts the raw data from the sRGB colorspace to a linear scale. Only works
on images with FORMAT_RGB8 or FORMAT_RGBA8 formats.
