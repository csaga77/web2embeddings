# MultiplayerPeer

Inherits: PacketPeer < RefCounted < Object

Inherited By: ENetMultiplayerPeer, MultiplayerPeerExtension,
OfflineMultiplayerPeer, WebRTCMultiplayerPeer, WebSocketMultiplayerPeer

Abstract class for specialized PacketPeers used by the MultiplayerAPI.

## Description

Manages the connection with one or more remote peers acting as server or
client and assigning unique IDs to each of them. See also MultiplayerAPI.

Note: The MultiplayerAPI protocol is an implementation detail and isn't meant
to be used by non-Godot servers. It may change without notice.

Note: When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the `INTERNET` permission
in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click
deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by
Android.

## Signals

peer_connected(id: int)

Emitted when a remote peer connects.

peer_disconnected(id: int)

Emitted when a remote peer has disconnected.

## Enumerations

enum ConnectionStatus:

ConnectionStatus CONNECTION_DISCONNECTED = `0`

The MultiplayerPeer is disconnected.

ConnectionStatus CONNECTION_CONNECTING = `1`

The MultiplayerPeer is currently connecting to a server.

ConnectionStatus CONNECTION_CONNECTED = `2`

This MultiplayerPeer is connected.

enum TransferMode:

TransferMode TRANSFER_MODE_UNRELIABLE = `0`

Packets are not acknowledged, no resend attempts are made for lost packets.
Packets may arrive in any order. Potentially faster than
TRANSFER_MODE_UNRELIABLE_ORDERED. Use for non-critical data, and always
consider whether the order matters.

TransferMode TRANSFER_MODE_UNRELIABLE_ORDERED = `1`

Packets are not acknowledged, no resend attempts are made for lost packets.
Packets are received in the order they were sent in. Potentially faster than
TRANSFER_MODE_RELIABLE. Use for non-critical data or data that would be
outdated if received late due to resend attempt(s) anyway, for example
movement and positional data.

TransferMode TRANSFER_MODE_RELIABLE = `2`

Packets must be received and resend attempts should be made until the packets
are acknowledged. Packets must be received in the order they were sent in.
Most reliable transfer mode, but potentially the slowest due to the overhead.
Use for critical data that must be transmitted and arrive in order, for
example an ability being triggered or a chat message. Consider carefully if
the information really is critical, and use sparingly.

## Constants

TARGET_PEER_BROADCAST = `0`

Packets are sent to all connected peers.

TARGET_PEER_SERVER = `1`

Packets are sent to the remote peer acting as server.

## Property Descriptions

bool refuse_new_connections = `false`

  * void set_refuse_new_connections(value: bool)

  * bool is_refusing_new_connections()

If `true`, this MultiplayerPeer refuses new connections.

int transfer_channel = `0`

  * void set_transfer_channel(value: int)

  * int get_transfer_channel()

The channel to use to send packets. Many network APIs such as ENet and WebRTC
allow the creation of multiple independent channels which behaves, in a way,
like separate connections. This means that reliable data will only block
delivery of other packets on that channel, and ordering will only be in
respect to the channel the packet is being sent on. Using different channels
to send different and independent state updates is a common way to optimize
network usage and decrease latency in fast-paced games.

Note: The default channel (`0`) actually works as 3 separate channels (one for
each TransferMode) so that TRANSFER_MODE_RELIABLE and
TRANSFER_MODE_UNRELIABLE_ORDERED does not interact with each other by default.
Refer to the specific network API documentation (e.g. ENet or WebRTC) to learn
how to set up channels correctly.

TransferMode transfer_mode = `2`

  * void set_transfer_mode(value: TransferMode)

  * TransferMode get_transfer_mode()

The manner in which to send packets to the target peer. See TransferMode, and
the set_target_peer() method.

## Method Descriptions

void close()

Immediately close the multiplayer peer returning to the state
CONNECTION_DISCONNECTED. Connected peers will be dropped without emitting
peer_disconnected.

void disconnect_peer(peer: int, force: bool = false)

Disconnects the given `peer` from this host. If `force` is `true` the
peer_disconnected signal will not be emitted for this peer.

int generate_unique_id() const

Returns a randomly generated integer that can be used as a network unique ID.

ConnectionStatus get_connection_status() const

Returns the current state of the connection. See ConnectionStatus.

int get_packet_channel() const

Returns the channel over which the next available packet was received. See
PacketPeer.get_available_packet_count().

TransferMode get_packet_mode() const

Returns the transfer mode the remote peer used to send the next available
packet. See PacketPeer.get_available_packet_count().

int get_packet_peer() const

Returns the ID of the MultiplayerPeer who sent the next available packet. See
PacketPeer.get_available_packet_count().

int get_unique_id() const

Returns the ID of this MultiplayerPeer.

bool is_server_relay_supported() const

Returns `true` if the server can act as a relay in the current configuration.
That is, if the higher level MultiplayerAPI should notify connected clients of
other peers, and implement a relay protocol to allow communication between
them.

void poll()

Waits up to 1 second to receive a new network event.

void set_target_peer(id: int)

Sets the peer to which packets will be sent.

The `id` can be one of: TARGET_PEER_BROADCAST to send to all connected peers,
TARGET_PEER_SERVER to send to the peer acting as server, a valid peer ID to
send to that specific peer, a negative peer ID to send to all peers except
that one. By default, the target peer is TARGET_PEER_BROADCAST.
