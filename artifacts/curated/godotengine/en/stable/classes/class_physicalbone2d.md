A RigidBody2D-derived node used to make Bone2Ds in a Skeleton2D react to
physics.

## Description

The PhysicalBone2D node is a RigidBody2D-based node that can be used to make
Bone2Ds in a Skeleton2D react to physics.

Note: To make the Bone2Ds visually follow the PhysicalBone2D node, use a
SkeletonModification2DPhysicalBones modification on the Skeleton2D parent.

Note: The PhysicalBone2D node does not automatically create a Joint2D node to
keep PhysicalBone2D nodes together. They must be created manually. For most
cases, you want to use a PinJoint2D node. The PhysicalBone2D node will
automatically configure the Joint2D node once it's been added as a child node.

## Properties

bool | auto_configure_joint | `true`  
---|---|---  
int | bone2d_index | `-1`  
NodePath | bone2d_nodepath | `NodePath("")`  
bool | follow_bone_when_simulating | `false`  
bool | simulate_physics | `false`  
  
## Methods

Joint2D | get_joint() const  
---|---  
bool | is_simulating_physics() const  
  
## Property Descriptions

bool auto_configure_joint = `true`

  * void set_auto_configure_joint(value: bool)

  * bool get_auto_configure_joint()

If `true`, the PhysicalBone2D will automatically configure the first Joint2D
child node. The automatic configuration is limited to setting up the node
properties and positioning the Joint2D.

int bone2d_index = `-1`

  * void set_bone2d_index(value: int)

  * int get_bone2d_index()

The index of the Bone2D that this PhysicalBone2D should simulate.

NodePath bone2d_nodepath = `NodePath("")`

  * void set_bone2d_nodepath(value: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_bone2d_nodepath()

The NodePath to the Bone2D that this PhysicalBone2D should simulate.

bool follow_bone_when_simulating = `false`

  * void set_follow_bone_when_simulating(value: bool)

  * bool get_follow_bone_when_simulating()

If `true`, the PhysicalBone2D will keep the transform of the bone it is bound
to when simulating physics.

bool simulate_physics = `false`

  * void set_simulate_physics(value: bool)

  * bool get_simulate_physics()

If `true`, the PhysicalBone2D will start simulating using physics. If `false`,
the PhysicalBone2D will follow the transform of the Bone2D node.

Note: To have the Bone2Ds visually follow the PhysicalBone2D, use a
SkeletonModification2DPhysicalBones modification on the Skeleton2D node with
the Bone2D nodes.

## Method Descriptions

Joint2D get_joint() const

Returns the first Joint2D child node, if one exists. This is mainly a helper
function to make it easier to get the Joint2D that the PhysicalBone2D is
autoconfiguring.

bool is_simulating_physics() const

Returns a boolean that indicates whether the PhysicalBone2D is running and
simulating using the Godot 2D physics engine. When `true`, the PhysicalBone2D
node is using physics.
