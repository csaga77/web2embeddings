Inherits: Object

Inherited By: RenderSceneDataExtension, RenderSceneDataRD

Abstract render data object, holds scene data related to rendering a single
frame of a viewport.

## Description

Abstract scene data object, exists for the duration of rendering a single
viewport.

Note: This is an internal rendering server object, do not instantiate this
from script.

## Method Descriptions

Projection get_cam_projection() const

Returns the camera projection used to render this frame.

Note: If more than one view is rendered, this will return a combined
projection.

Transform3D get_cam_transform() const

Returns the camera transform used to render this frame.

Note: If more than one view is rendered, this will return a centered
transform.

RID get_uniform_buffer() const

Return the RID of the uniform buffer containing the scene data as a UBO.

int get_view_count() const

Returns the number of views being rendered.

Vector3 get_view_eye_offset(view: int) const

Returns the eye offset per view used to render this frame. This is the offset
between our camera transform and the eye transform.

Projection get_view_projection(view: int) const

Returns the view projection per view used to render this frame.

Note: If a single view is rendered, this returns the camera projection. If
more than one view is rendered, this will return a projection for the given
view including the eye offset.
