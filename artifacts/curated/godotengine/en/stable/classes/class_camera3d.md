Camera node, displays from a point of view.

## Description

Camera3D is a special node that displays what is visible from its current
location. Cameras register themselves in the nearest Viewport node (when
ascending the tree). Only one camera can be active per viewport. If no
viewport is available ascending the tree, the camera will register in the
global viewport. In other words, a camera just provides 3D display
capabilities to a Viewport, and, without one, a scene registered in that
Viewport (or higher viewports) can't be displayed.

## Enumerations

enum ProjectionType:

ProjectionType PROJECTION_PERSPECTIVE = `0`

Perspective projection. Objects on the screen becomes smaller when they are
far away.

ProjectionType PROJECTION_ORTHOGONAL = `1`

Orthogonal projection, also known as orthographic projection. Objects remain
the same size on the screen no matter how far away they are.

ProjectionType PROJECTION_FRUSTUM = `2`

Frustum projection. This mode allows adjusting frustum_offset to create
"tilted frustum" effects.

enum KeepAspect:

KeepAspect KEEP_WIDTH = `0`

Preserves the horizontal aspect ratio; also known as Vert- scaling. This is
usually the best option for projects running in portrait mode, as taller
aspect ratios will benefit from a wider vertical FOV.

KeepAspect KEEP_HEIGHT = `1`

Preserves the vertical aspect ratio; also known as Hor+ scaling. This is
usually the best option for projects running in landscape mode, as wider
aspect ratios will automatically benefit from a wider horizontal FOV.

enum DopplerTracking:

DopplerTracking DOPPLER_TRACKING_DISABLED = `0`

Disables Doppler effect simulation (default).

DopplerTracking DOPPLER_TRACKING_IDLE_STEP = `1`

Simulate Doppler effect by tracking positions of objects that are changed in
`_process`. Changes in the relative velocity of this camera compared to those
objects affect how audio is perceived (changing the audio's
AudioStreamPlayer3D.pitch_scale).

DopplerTracking DOPPLER_TRACKING_PHYSICS_STEP = `2`

Simulate Doppler effect by tracking positions of objects that are changed in
`_physics_process`. Changes in the relative velocity of this camera compared
to those objects affect how audio is perceived (changing the audio's
AudioStreamPlayer3D.pitch_scale).

## Property Descriptions

CameraAttributes attributes

  * void set_attributes(value: CameraAttributes)

  * CameraAttributes get_attributes()

The CameraAttributes to use for this camera.

Compositor compositor

  * void set_compositor(value: Compositor)

  * Compositor get_compositor()

The Compositor to use for this camera.

int cull_mask = `1048575`

  * void set_cull_mask(value: int)

  * int get_cull_mask()

The culling mask that describes which VisualInstance3D.layers are rendered by
this camera. By default, all 20 user-visible layers are rendered.

Note: Since the cull_mask allows for 32 layers to be stored in total, there
are an additional 12 layers that are only used internally by the engine and
aren't exposed in the editor. Setting cull_mask using a script allows you to
toggle those reserved layers, which can be useful for editor plugins.

To adjust cull_mask more easily using a script, use get_cull_mask_value() and
set_cull_mask_value().

Note: VoxelGI, SDFGI and LightmapGI will always take all layers into account
to determine what contributes to global illumination. If this is an issue, set
GeometryInstance3D.gi_mode to GeometryInstance3D.GI_MODE_DISABLED for meshes
and Light3D.light_bake_mode to Light3D.BAKE_DISABLED for lights to exclude
them from global illumination.

bool current = `false`

  * void set_current(value: bool)

  * bool is_current()

If `true`, the ancestor Viewport is currently using this camera.

If multiple cameras are in the scene, one will always be made current. For
example, if two Camera3D nodes are present in the scene and only one is
current, setting one camera's current to `false` will cause the other camera
to be made current.

DopplerTracking doppler_tracking = `0`

  * void set_doppler_tracking(value: DopplerTracking)

  * DopplerTracking get_doppler_tracking()

If not DOPPLER_TRACKING_DISABLED, this camera will simulate the Doppler effect
for objects changed in particular `_process` methods. See DopplerTracking for
possible values.

Environment environment

  * void set_environment(value: Environment)

  * Environment get_environment()

The Environment to use for this camera.

float far = `4000.0`

  * void set_far(value: float)

  * float get_far()

The distance to the far culling boundary for this camera relative to its local
Z axis. Higher values allow the camera to see further away, while decreasing
far can improve performance if it results in objects being partially or fully
culled.

float fov = `75.0`

  * void set_fov(value: float)

  * float get_fov()

The camera's field of view angle (in degrees). Only applicable in perspective
mode. Since keep_aspect locks one axis, fov sets the other axis' field of view
angle.

For reference, the default vertical field of view value (`75.0`) is equivalent
to a horizontal FOV of:

  * ~91.31 degrees in a 4:3 viewport

  * ~101.67 degrees in a 16:10 viewport

  * ~107.51 degrees in a 16:9 viewport

  * ~121.63 degrees in a 21:9 viewport

Vector2 frustum_offset = `Vector2(0, 0)`

  * void set_frustum_offset(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_frustum_offset()

The camera's frustum offset. This can be changed from the default to create
"tilted frustum" effects such as Y-shearing.

Note: Only effective if projection is PROJECTION_FRUSTUM.

float h_offset = `0.0`

  * void set_h_offset(value: float)

  * float get_h_offset()

The horizontal (X) offset of the camera viewport.

KeepAspect keep_aspect = `1`

  * void set_keep_aspect_mode(value: KeepAspect)

  * KeepAspect get_keep_aspect_mode()

The axis to lock during fov/size adjustments. Can be either KEEP_WIDTH or
KEEP_HEIGHT.

float near = `0.05`

  * void set_near(value: float)

  * float get_near()

The distance to the near culling boundary for this camera relative to its
local Z axis. Lower values allow the camera to see objects more up close to
its origin, at the cost of lower precision across the entire range. Values
lower than the default can lead to increased Z-fighting.

ProjectionType projection = `0`

  * void set_projection(value: ProjectionType)

  * ProjectionType get_projection()

The camera's projection mode. In PROJECTION_PERSPECTIVE mode, objects' Z
distance from the camera's local space scales their perceived size.

float size = `1.0`

  * void set_size(value: float)

  * float get_size()

The camera's size in meters measured as the diameter of the width or height,
depending on keep_aspect. Only applicable in orthogonal and frustum modes.

float v_offset = `0.0`

  * void set_v_offset(value: float)

  * float get_v_offset()

The vertical (Y) offset of the camera viewport.

## Method Descriptions

void clear_current(enable_next: bool = true)

If this is the current camera, remove it from being current. If `enable_next`
is `true`, request to make the next camera current, if any.

Projection get_camera_projection() const

Returns the projection matrix that this camera uses to render to its
associated viewport. The camera must be part of the scene tree to function.

RID get_camera_rid() const

Returns the camera's RID from the RenderingServer.

Transform3D get_camera_transform() const

Returns the transform of the camera plus the vertical (v_offset) and
horizontal (h_offset) offsets; and any other adjustments made to the position
and orientation of the camera by subclassed cameras such as XRCamera3D.

bool get_cull_mask_value(layer_number: int) const

Returns whether or not the specified layer of the cull_mask is enabled, given
a `layer_number` between 1 and 20.

Array[Plane] get_frustum() const

Returns the camera's frustum planes in world space units as an array of Planes
in the following order: near, far, left, top, right, bottom. Not to be
confused with frustum_offset.

RID get_pyramid_shape_rid()

Returns the RID of a pyramid shape encompassing the camera's view frustum,
ignoring the camera's near plane. The tip of the pyramid represents the
position of the camera.

bool is_position_behind(world_point: Vector3) const

Returns `true` if the given position is behind the camera (the blue part of
the linked diagram). See this diagram for an overview of position query
methods.

Note: A position which returns `false` may still be outside the camera's field
of view.

bool is_position_in_frustum(world_point: Vector3) const

Returns `true` if the given position is inside the camera's frustum (the green
part of the linked diagram). See this diagram for an overview of position
query methods.

void make_current()

Makes this camera the current camera for the Viewport (see class description).
If the camera node is outside the scene tree, it will attempt to become
current once it's added.

Vector3 project_local_ray_normal(screen_point: Vector2) const

Returns a normal vector from the screen point location directed along the
camera. Orthogonal cameras are normalized. Perspective cameras account for
perspective, screen width/height, etc.

Vector3 project_position(screen_point: Vector2, z_depth: float) const

Returns the 3D point in world space that maps to the given 2D coordinate in
the Viewport rectangle on a plane that is the given `z_depth` distance into
the scene away from the camera.

Vector3 project_ray_normal(screen_point: Vector2) const

Returns a normal vector in world space, that is the result of projecting a
point on the Viewport rectangle by the inverse camera projection. This is
useful for casting rays in the form of (origin, normal) for object
intersection or picking.

Vector3 project_ray_origin(screen_point: Vector2) const

Returns a 3D position in world space, that is the result of projecting a point
on the Viewport rectangle by the inverse camera projection. This is useful for
casting rays in the form of (origin, normal) for object intersection or
picking.

void set_cull_mask_value(layer_number: int, value: bool)

Based on `value`, enables or disables the specified layer in the cull_mask,
given a `layer_number` between 1 and 20.

void set_frustum(size: float, offset: Vector2, z_near: float, z_far: float)

Sets the camera projection to frustum mode (see PROJECTION_FRUSTUM), by
specifying a `size`, an `offset`, and the `z_near` and `z_far` clip planes in
world space units. See also frustum_offset.

void set_orthogonal(size: float, z_near: float, z_far: float)

Sets the camera projection to orthogonal mode (see PROJECTION_ORTHOGONAL), by
specifying a `size`, and the `z_near` and `z_far` clip planes in world space
units. (As a hint, 2D games often use this projection, with values specified
in pixels.)

void set_perspective(fov: float, z_near: float, z_far: float)

Sets the camera projection to perspective mode (see PROJECTION_PERSPECTIVE),
by specifying a `fov` (field of view) angle in degrees, and the `z_near` and
`z_far` clip planes in world space units.

Vector2 unproject_position(world_point: Vector3) const

Returns the 2D coordinate in the Viewport rectangle that maps to the given 3D
point in world space.

Note: When using this to position GUI elements over a 3D viewport, use
is_position_behind() to prevent them from appearing if the 3D point is behind
the camera:

    
    
    # This code block is part of a script that inherits from Node3D.
    # `control` is a reference to a node inheriting from Control.
    control.visible = not get_viewport().get_camera_3d().is_position_behind(global_transform.origin)
    control.position = get_viewport().get_camera_3d().unproject_position(global_transform.origin)
