A CSG Sphere shape.

## Description

This node allows you to create a sphere for use with the CSG system.

Note: CSG nodes are intended to be used for level prototyping. Creating CSG
nodes has a significant CPU cost compared to creating a MeshInstance3D with a
PrimitiveMesh. Moving a CSG node within another CSG node also has a
significant CPU cost, so it should be avoided during gameplay.

## Properties

Material | material  
---|---  
int | radial_segments | `12`  
float | radius | `0.5`  
int | rings | `6`  
bool | smooth_faces | `true`  
  
## Property Descriptions

Material material

  * void set_material(value: Material)

  * Material get_material()

The material used to render the sphere.

int radial_segments = `12`

  * void set_radial_segments(value: int)

  * int get_radial_segments()

Number of vertical slices for the sphere.

float radius = `0.5`

  * void set_radius(value: float)

  * float get_radius()

Radius of the sphere.

int rings = `6`

  * void set_rings(value: int)

  * int get_rings()

Number of horizontal slices for the sphere.

bool smooth_faces = `true`

  * void set_smooth_faces(value: bool)

  * bool get_smooth_faces()

If `true` the normals of the sphere are set to give a smooth effect making the
sphere seem rounded. If `false` the sphere will have a flat shaded look.
