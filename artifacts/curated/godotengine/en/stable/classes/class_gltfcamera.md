## Property Descriptions

float depth_far = `4000.0`

  * void set_depth_far(value: float)

  * float get_depth_far()

The distance to the far culling boundary for this camera relative to its local
Z axis, in meters. This maps to glTF's `zfar` property.

float depth_near = `0.05`

  * void set_depth_near(value: float)

  * float get_depth_near()

The distance to the near culling boundary for this camera relative to its
local Z axis, in meters. This maps to glTF's `znear` property.

float fov = `1.309`

  * void set_fov(value: float)

  * float get_fov()

The FOV of the camera. This class and glTF define the camera FOV in radians,
while Godot uses degrees. This maps to glTF's `yfov` property. This value is
only used for perspective cameras, when perspective is `true`.

bool perspective = `true`

  * void set_perspective(value: bool)

  * bool get_perspective()

If `true`, the camera is in perspective mode. Otherwise, the camera is in
orthographic/orthogonal mode. This maps to glTF's camera `type` property. See
Camera3D.projection and the glTF spec for more information.

float size_mag = `0.5`

  * void set_size_mag(value: float)

  * float get_size_mag()

The size of the camera. This class and glTF define the camera size magnitude
as a radius in meters, while Godot defines it as a diameter in meters. This
maps to glTF's `ymag` property. This value is only used for
orthographic/orthogonal cameras, when perspective is `false`.

## Method Descriptions

GLTFCamera from_dictionary(dictionary: Dictionary) static

Creates a new GLTFCamera instance by parsing the given Dictionary.

GLTFCamera from_node(camera_node: Camera3D) static

Create a new GLTFCamera instance from the given Godot Camera3D node.

Dictionary to_dictionary() const

Serializes this GLTFCamera instance into a Dictionary.

Camera3D to_node() const

Converts this GLTFCamera instance into a Godot Camera3D node.

  *[static]: This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.
  *[const]: This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.
  *[void]: No return value.
