# VFlowContainer

Inherits: FlowContainer < Container < Control < CanvasItem < Node < Object

A container that arranges its child controls vertically and wraps them around
at the borders.

## Description

A variant of FlowContainer that can only arrange its child controls
vertically, wrapping them around at the borders. This is similar to how text
in a book wraps around when no more words can fit on a line, except
vertically.
