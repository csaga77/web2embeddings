# RDPipelineMultisampleState

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Pipeline multisample state (used by RenderingDevice).

## Description

RDPipelineMultisampleState is used to control how multisample or supersample
antialiasing is being performed when rendering using RenderingDevice.

## Properties

bool | enable_alpha_to_coverage | `false`  
---|---|---  
bool | enable_alpha_to_one | `false`  
bool | enable_sample_shading | `false`  
float | min_sample_shading | `0.0`  
TextureSamples | sample_count | `0`  
Array[int] | sample_masks | `[]`  
  
## Property Descriptions

bool enable_alpha_to_coverage = `false`

  * void set_enable_alpha_to_coverage(value: bool)

  * bool get_enable_alpha_to_coverage()

If `true`, alpha to coverage is enabled. This generates a temporary coverage
value based on the alpha component of the fragment's first color output. This
allows alpha transparency to make use of multisample antialiasing.

bool enable_alpha_to_one = `false`

  * void set_enable_alpha_to_one(value: bool)

  * bool get_enable_alpha_to_one()

If `true`, alpha is forced to either `0.0` or `1.0`. This allows hardening the
edges of antialiased alpha transparencies. Only relevant if
enable_alpha_to_coverage is `true`.

bool enable_sample_shading = `false`

  * void set_enable_sample_shading(value: bool)

  * bool get_enable_sample_shading()

If `true`, enables per-sample shading which replaces MSAA by SSAA. This
provides higher quality antialiasing that works with transparent (alpha
scissor) edges. This has a very high performance cost. See also
min_sample_shading. See the per-sample shading Vulkan documentation for more
details.

float min_sample_shading = `0.0`

  * void set_min_sample_shading(value: float)

  * float get_min_sample_shading()

The multiplier of sample_count that determines how many samples are performed
for each fragment. Must be between `0.0` and `1.0` (inclusive). Only effective
if enable_sample_shading is `true`. If min_sample_shading is `1.0`, fragment
invocation must only read from the coverage index sample. Tile image access
must not be used if enable_sample_shading is not `1.0`.

TextureSamples sample_count = `0`

  * void set_sample_count(value: TextureSamples)

  * TextureSamples get_sample_count()

The number of MSAA samples (or SSAA samples if enable_sample_shading is
`true`) to perform. Higher values result in better antialiasing, at the cost
of performance.

Array[int] sample_masks = `[]`

  * void set_sample_masks(value: Array[int])

  * Array[int] get_sample_masks()

The sample mask array. See the sample mask Vulkan documentation for more
details.
