Class representing a planar PrimitiveMesh.

## Description

Class representing a planar PrimitiveMesh. This flat mesh does not have a
thickness. By default, this mesh is aligned on the X and Z axes; this default
rotation isn't suited for use with billboarded materials. For billboarded
materials, change orientation to FACE_Z.

Note: When using a large textured PlaneMesh (e.g. as a floor), you may stumble
upon UV jittering issues depending on the camera angle. To solve this,
increase subdivide_depth and subdivide_width until you no longer notice UV
jittering.

## Properties

Vector3 | center_offset | `Vector3(0, 0, 0)`  
---|---|---  
Orientation | orientation | `1`  
Vector2 | size | `Vector2(2, 2)`  
int | subdivide_depth | `0`  
int | subdivide_width | `0`  
  
## Enumerations

enum Orientation:

Orientation FACE_X = `0`

PlaneMesh will face the positive X-axis.

Orientation FACE_Y = `1`

PlaneMesh will face the positive Y-axis. This matches the behavior of the
PlaneMesh in Godot 3.x.

Orientation FACE_Z = `2`

PlaneMesh will face the positive Z-axis. This matches the behavior of the
QuadMesh in Godot 3.x.

## Property Descriptions

Vector3 center_offset = `Vector3(0, 0, 0)`

  * void set_center_offset(value: Vector3)

  * Vector3 get_center_offset()

Offset of the generated plane. Useful for particles.

Orientation orientation = `1`

  * void set_orientation(value: Orientation)

  * Orientation get_orientation()

Direction that the PlaneMesh is facing. See Orientation for options.

Vector2 size = `Vector2(2, 2)`

  * void set_size(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_size()

Size of the generated plane.

int subdivide_depth = `0`

  * void set_subdivide_depth(value: int)

  * int get_subdivide_depth()

Number of subdivision along the Z axis.

int subdivide_width = `0`

  * void set_subdivide_width(value: int)

  * int get_subdivide_width()

Number of subdivision along the X axis.
