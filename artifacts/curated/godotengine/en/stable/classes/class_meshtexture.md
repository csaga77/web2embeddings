# MeshTexture

Inherits: Texture2D < Texture < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Simple texture that uses a mesh to draw itself.

## Description

Simple texture that uses a mesh to draw itself. It's limited because flags
can't be changed and region drawing is not supported.

## Properties

Texture2D | base_texture  
---|---  
Vector2 | image_size | `Vector2(0, 0)`  
Mesh | mesh  
bool | resource_local_to_scene | `false` (overrides Resource)  
  
## Property Descriptions

Texture2D base_texture

  * void set_base_texture(value: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_base_texture()

Sets the base texture that the Mesh will use to draw.

Vector2 image_size = `Vector2(0, 0)`

  * void set_image_size(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_image_size()

Sets the size of the image, needed for reference.

Mesh mesh

  * void set_mesh(value: Mesh)

  * Mesh get_mesh()

Sets the mesh used to draw. It must be a mesh using 2D vertices.
