# MultiplayerAPI

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Inherited By: MultiplayerAPIExtension, SceneMultiplayer

High-level multiplayer API interface.

## Description

Base class for high-level multiplayer API implementations. See also
MultiplayerPeer.

By default, SceneTree has a reference to an implementation of this class and
uses it to provide multiplayer capabilities (i.e. RPCs) across the whole
scene.

It is possible to override the MultiplayerAPI instance used by specific tree
branches by calling the SceneTree.set_multiplayer() method, effectively
allowing to run both client and server in the same scene.

It is also possible to extend or replace the default implementation via
scripting or native extensions. See MultiplayerAPIExtension for details about
extensions, SceneMultiplayer for the details about the default implementation.

## Signals

connected_to_server()

Emitted when this MultiplayerAPI's multiplayer_peer successfully connected to
a server. Only emitted on clients.

connection_failed()

Emitted when this MultiplayerAPI's multiplayer_peer fails to establish a
connection to a server. Only emitted on clients.

peer_connected(id: int)

Emitted when this MultiplayerAPI's multiplayer_peer connects with a new peer.
ID is the peer ID of the new peer. Clients get notified when other clients
connect to the same server. Upon connecting to a server, a client also
receives this signal for the server (with ID being 1).

peer_disconnected(id: int)

Emitted when this MultiplayerAPI's multiplayer_peer disconnects from a peer.
Clients get notified when other clients disconnect from the same server.

server_disconnected()

Emitted when this MultiplayerAPI's multiplayer_peer disconnects from server.
Only emitted on clients.

## Enumerations

enum RPCMode:

RPCMode RPC_MODE_DISABLED = `0`

Used with Node.rpc_config() to disable a method or property for all RPC calls,
making it unavailable. Default for all methods.

RPCMode RPC_MODE_ANY_PEER = `1`

Used with Node.rpc_config() to set a method to be callable remotely by any
peer. Analogous to the `@rpc("any_peer")` annotation. Calls are accepted from
all remote peers, no matter if they are node's authority or not.

RPCMode RPC_MODE_AUTHORITY = `2`

Used with Node.rpc_config() to set a method to be callable remotely only by
the current multiplayer authority (which is the server by default). Analogous
to the `@rpc("authority")` annotation. See Node.set_multiplayer_authority().

## Property Descriptions

MultiplayerPeer multiplayer_peer

  * void set_multiplayer_peer(value: MultiplayerPeer)

  * MultiplayerPeer get_multiplayer_peer()

The peer object to handle the RPC system (effectively enabling networking when
set). Depending on the peer itself, the MultiplayerAPI will become a network
server (check with is_server()) and will set root node's network mode to
authority, or it will become a regular client peer. All child nodes are set to
inherit the network mode by default. Handling of networking-related events
(connection, disconnection, new clients) is done by connecting to
MultiplayerAPI's signals.

## Method Descriptions

MultiplayerAPI create_default_interface() static

Returns a new instance of the default MultiplayerAPI.

StringName get_default_interface() static

Returns the default MultiplayerAPI implementation class name. This is usually
`"SceneMultiplayer"` when SceneMultiplayer is available. See
set_default_interface().

PackedInt32Array get_peers()

Returns the peer IDs of all connected peers of this MultiplayerAPI's
multiplayer_peer.

int get_remote_sender_id()

Returns the sender's peer ID for the RPC currently being executed.

Note: This method returns `0` when called outside of an RPC. As such, the
original peer ID may be lost when code execution is delayed (such as with
GDScript's `await` keyword).

int get_unique_id()

Returns the unique peer ID of this MultiplayerAPI's multiplayer_peer.

bool has_multiplayer_peer()

Returns `true` if there is a multiplayer_peer set.

bool is_server()

Returns `true` if this MultiplayerAPI's multiplayer_peer is valid and in
server mode (listening for connections).

Error object_configuration_add(object: Object, configuration: Variant)

Notifies the MultiplayerAPI of a new `configuration` for the given `object`.
This method is used internally by SceneTree to configure the root path for
this MultiplayerAPI (passing `null` and a valid NodePath as `configuration`).
This method can be further used by MultiplayerAPI implementations to provide
additional features, refer to specific implementation (e.g. SceneMultiplayer)
for details on how they use it.

Note: This method is mostly relevant when extending or overriding the
MultiplayerAPI behavior via MultiplayerAPIExtension.

Error object_configuration_remove(object: Object, configuration: Variant)

Notifies the MultiplayerAPI to remove a `configuration` for the given
`object`. This method is used internally by SceneTree to configure the root
path for this MultiplayerAPI (passing `null` and an empty NodePath as
`configuration`). This method can be further used by MultiplayerAPI
implementations to provide additional features, refer to specific
implementation (e.g. SceneMultiplayer) for details on how they use it.

Note: This method is mostly relevant when extending or overriding the
MultiplayerAPI behavior via MultiplayerAPIExtension.

Error poll()

Method used for polling the MultiplayerAPI. You only need to worry about this
if you set SceneTree.multiplayer_poll to `false`. By default, SceneTree will
poll its MultiplayerAPI(s) for you.

Note: This method results in RPCs being called, so they will be executed in
the same context of this function (e.g. `_process`, `physics`, Thread).

Error rpc(peer: int, object: Object, method: StringName, arguments: Array =
[])

Sends an RPC to the target `peer`. The given `method` will be called on the
remote `object` with the provided `arguments`. The RPC may also be called
locally depending on the implementation and RPC configuration. See Node.rpc()
and Node.rpc_config().

Note: Prefer using Node.rpc(), Node.rpc_id(), or `my_method.rpc(peer, arg1,
arg2, ...)` (in GDScript), since they are faster. This method is mostly useful
in conjunction with MultiplayerAPIExtension when extending or replacing the
multiplayer capabilities.

void set_default_interface(interface_name: StringName) static

Sets the default MultiplayerAPI implementation class. This method can be used
by modules and extensions to configure which implementation will be used by
SceneTree when the engine starts.

  *[void]: No return value.
