# TLSOptions

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

TLS configuration for clients and servers.

## Description

TLSOptions abstracts the configuration options for the StreamPeerTLS and
PacketPeerDTLS classes.

Objects of this class cannot be instantiated directly, and one of the static
methods client(), client_unsafe(), or server() should be used instead.

GDScript

    
    
    # Create a TLS client configuration which uses our custom trusted CA chain.
    var client_trusted_cas = load("res://my_trusted_cas.crt")
    var client_tls_options = TLSOptions.client(client_trusted_cas)
    
    # Create a TLS server configuration.
    var server_certs = load("res://my_server_cas.crt")
    var server_key = load("res://my_server_key.key")
    var server_tls_options = TLSOptions.server(server_key, server_certs)

## Method Descriptions

TLSOptions client(trusted_chain: X509Certificate = null, common_name_override:
String = "") static

Creates a TLS client configuration which validates certificates and their
common names (fully qualified domain names).

You can specify a custom `trusted_chain` of certification authorities (the
default CA list will be used if `null`), and optionally provide a
`common_name_override` if you expect the certificate to have a common name
other than the server FQDN.

Note: On the Web platform, TLS verification is always enforced against the CA
list of the web browser. This is considered a security feature.

TLSOptions client_unsafe(trusted_chain: X509Certificate = null) static

Creates an unsafe TLS client configuration where certificate validation is
optional. You can optionally provide a valid `trusted_chain`, but the common
name of the certificates will never be checked. Using this configuration for
purposes other than testing is not recommended.

Note: On the Web platform, TLS verification is always enforced against the CA
list of the web browser. This is considered a security feature.

String get_common_name_override() const

Returns the common name (domain name) override specified when creating with
client().

X509Certificate get_own_certificate() const

Returns the X509Certificate specified when creating with server().

CryptoKey get_private_key() const

Returns the CryptoKey specified when creating with server().

X509Certificate get_trusted_ca_chain() const

Returns the CA X509Certificate chain specified when creating with client() or
client_unsafe().

bool is_server() const

Returns `true` if created with server(), `false` otherwise.

bool is_unsafe_client() const

Returns `true` if created with client_unsafe(), `false` otherwise.

TLSOptions server(key: CryptoKey, certificate: X509Certificate) static

Creates a TLS server configuration using the provided `key` and `certificate`.

Note: The `certificate` should include the full certificate chain up to the
signing CA (certificates file can be concatenated using a general purpose text
editor).
