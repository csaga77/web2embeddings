## Enumerations

enum WriteMode:

WriteMode WRITE_MODE_TEXT = `0`

Tells the channel to send data over this channel as text. An external peer
(non-Godot) would receive this as a string.

WriteMode WRITE_MODE_BINARY = `1`

Tells the channel to send data over this channel as binary. An external peer
(non-Godot) would receive this as array buffer or blob.

enum ChannelState:

ChannelState STATE_CONNECTING = `0`

The channel was created, but it's still trying to connect.

ChannelState STATE_OPEN = `1`

The channel is currently open, and data can flow over it.

ChannelState STATE_CLOSING = `2`

The channel is being closed, no new messages will be accepted, but those
already in queue will be flushed.

ChannelState STATE_CLOSED = `3`

The channel was closed, or connection failed.

## Property Descriptions

WriteMode write_mode = `1`

  * void set_write_mode(value: WriteMode)

  * WriteMode get_write_mode()

The transfer mode to use when sending outgoing packet. Either text or binary.

## Method Descriptions

void close()

Closes this data channel, notifying the other peer.

int get_buffered_amount() const

Returns the number of bytes currently queued to be sent over this channel.

int get_id() const

Returns the ID assigned to this channel during creation (or auto-assigned
during negotiation).

If the channel is not negotiated out-of-band the ID will only be available
after the connection is established (will return `65535` until then).

String get_label() const

Returns the label assigned to this channel during creation.

int get_max_packet_life_time() const

Returns the `maxPacketLifeTime` value assigned to this channel during
creation.

Will be `65535` if not specified.

int get_max_retransmits() const

Returns the `maxRetransmits` value assigned to this channel during creation.

Will be `65535` if not specified.

String get_protocol() const

Returns the sub-protocol assigned to this channel during creation. An empty
string if not specified.

ChannelState get_ready_state() const

Returns the current state of this channel, see ChannelState.

bool is_negotiated() const

Returns `true` if this channel was created with out-of-band configuration.

bool is_ordered() const

Returns `true` if this channel was created with ordering enabled (default).

Error poll()

Reserved, but not used for now.

bool was_string_packet() const

Returns `true` if the last received packet was transferred as text. See
write_mode.
