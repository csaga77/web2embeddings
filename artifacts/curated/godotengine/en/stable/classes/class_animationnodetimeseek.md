# AnimationNodeTimeSeek

Inherits: AnimationNode < Resource < RefCounted < Object

A time-seeking animation node used in AnimationTree.

## Description

This animation node can be used to cause a seek command to happen to any sub-
children of the animation graph. Use to play an Animation from the start or a
certain playback position inside the AnimationNodeBlendTree.

After setting the time and changing the animation playback, the time seek node
automatically goes into sleep mode on the next process frame by setting its
`seek_request` value to `-1.0`.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    # Play child animation from the start.
    animation_tree.set("parameters/TimeSeek/seek_request", 0.0)
    # Alternative syntax (same result as above).
    animation_tree["parameters/TimeSeek/seek_request"] = 0.0
    
    # Play child animation from 12 second timestamp.
    animation_tree.set("parameters/TimeSeek/seek_request", 12.0)
    # Alternative syntax (same result as above).
    animation_tree["parameters/TimeSeek/seek_request"] = 12.0
    
    
    
    // Play child animation from the start.
    animationTree.Set("parameters/TimeSeek/seek_request", 0.0);
    
    // Play child animation from 12 second timestamp.
    animationTree.Set("parameters/TimeSeek/seek_request", 12.0);

## Properties

bool | explicit_elapse | `true`  
---|---|---  
  
## Property Descriptions

bool explicit_elapse = `true`

  * void set_explicit_elapse(value: bool)

  * bool is_explicit_elapse()

If `true`, some processes are executed to handle keys between seeks, such as
calculating root motion and finding the nearest discrete key.
