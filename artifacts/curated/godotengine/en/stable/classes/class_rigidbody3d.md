# RigidBody3D

Inherits: PhysicsBody3D < CollisionObject3D < Node3D < Node < Object

Inherited By: VehicleBody3D

A 3D physics body that is moved by a physics simulation.

## Description

RigidBody3D implements full 3D physics. It cannot be controlled directly,
instead, you must apply forces to it (gravity, impulses, etc.), and the
physics simulation will calculate the resulting movement, rotation, react to
collisions, and affect other physics bodies in its path.

The body's behavior can be adjusted via lock_rotation, freeze, and
freeze_mode. By changing various properties of the object, such as mass, you
can control how the physics simulation acts on it.

A rigid body will always maintain its shape and size, even when forces are
applied to it. It is useful for objects that can be interacted with in an
environment, such as a tree that can be knocked over or a stack of crates that
can be pushed around.

If you need to override the default physics behavior, you can write a custom
force integration function. See custom_integrator.

Note: Changing the 3D transform or linear_velocity of a RigidBody3D very often
may lead to some unpredictable behaviors. If you need to directly affect the
body, prefer _integrate_forces() as it allows you to directly access the
physics state.

## Enumerations

enum FreezeMode:

FreezeMode FREEZE_MODE_STATIC = `0`

Static body freeze mode (default). The body is not affected by gravity and
forces. It can be only moved by user code and doesn't collide with other
bodies along its path.

FreezeMode FREEZE_MODE_KINEMATIC = `1`

Kinematic body freeze mode. Similar to FREEZE_MODE_STATIC, but collides with
other bodies along its path when moved. Useful for a frozen body that needs to
be animated.

enum CenterOfMassMode:

CenterOfMassMode CENTER_OF_MASS_MODE_AUTO = `0`

In this mode, the body's center of mass is calculated automatically based on
its shapes. This assumes that the shapes' origins are also their center of
mass.

CenterOfMassMode CENTER_OF_MASS_MODE_CUSTOM = `1`

In this mode, the body's center of mass is set through center_of_mass.
Defaults to the body's origin position.

enum DampMode:

DampMode DAMP_MODE_COMBINE = `0`

In this mode, the body's damping value is added to any value set in areas or
the default value.

DampMode DAMP_MODE_REPLACE = `1`

In this mode, the body's damping value replaces any value set in areas or the
default value.

## Property Descriptions

float angular_damp = `0.0`

  * void set_angular_damp(value: float)

  * float get_angular_damp()

Damps the body's rotation. By default, the body will use the
ProjectSettings.physics/3d/default_angular_damp project setting or any value
override set by an Area3D the body is in. Depending on angular_damp_mode, you
can set angular_damp to be added to or to replace the body's damping value.

See ProjectSettings.physics/3d/default_angular_damp for more details about
damping.

DampMode angular_damp_mode = `0`

  * void set_angular_damp_mode(value: DampMode)

  * DampMode get_angular_damp_mode()

Defines how angular_damp is applied. See DampMode for possible values.

Vector3 angular_velocity = `Vector3(0, 0, 0)`

  * void set_angular_velocity(value: Vector3)

  * Vector3 get_angular_velocity()

The RigidBody3D's rotational velocity in radians per second.

bool can_sleep = `true`

  * void set_can_sleep(value: bool)

  * bool is_able_to_sleep()

If `true`, the body can enter sleep mode when there is no movement. See
sleeping.

Vector3 center_of_mass = `Vector3(0, 0, 0)`

  * void set_center_of_mass(value: Vector3)

  * Vector3 get_center_of_mass()

The body's custom center of mass, relative to the body's origin position, when
center_of_mass_mode is set to CENTER_OF_MASS_MODE_CUSTOM. This is the balanced
point of the body, where applied forces only cause linear acceleration.
Applying forces outside of the center of mass causes angular acceleration.

When center_of_mass_mode is set to CENTER_OF_MASS_MODE_AUTO (default value),
the center of mass is automatically computed.

CenterOfMassMode center_of_mass_mode = `0`

  * void set_center_of_mass_mode(value: CenterOfMassMode)

  * CenterOfMassMode get_center_of_mass_mode()

Defines the way the body's center of mass is set. See CenterOfMassMode for
possible values.

Vector3 constant_force = `Vector3(0, 0, 0)`

  * void set_constant_force(value: Vector3)

  * Vector3 get_constant_force()

The body's total constant positional forces applied during each physics
update.

See add_constant_force() and add_constant_central_force().

Vector3 constant_torque = `Vector3(0, 0, 0)`

  * void set_constant_torque(value: Vector3)

  * Vector3 get_constant_torque()

The body's total constant rotational forces applied during each physics
update.

See add_constant_torque().

bool contact_monitor = `false`

  * void set_contact_monitor(value: bool)

  * bool is_contact_monitor_enabled()

If `true`, the RigidBody3D will emit signals when it collides with another
body.

Note: By default the maximum contacts reported is set to 0, meaning nothing
will be recorded, see max_contacts_reported.

bool continuous_cd = `false`

  * void set_use_continuous_collision_detection(value: bool)

  * bool is_using_continuous_collision_detection()

If `true`, continuous collision detection is used.

Continuous collision detection tries to predict where a moving body will
collide, instead of moving it and correcting its movement if it collided.
Continuous collision detection is more precise, and misses fewer impacts by
small, fast-moving objects. Not using continuous collision detection is faster
to compute, but can miss small, fast-moving objects.

bool custom_integrator = `false`

  * void set_use_custom_integrator(value: bool)

  * bool is_using_custom_integrator()

If `true`, the standard force integration (like gravity or damping) will be
disabled for this body. Other than collision response, the body will only move
as determined by the _integrate_forces() method, if that virtual method is
overridden.

Setting this property will call the method
PhysicsServer3D.body_set_omit_force_integration() internally.

bool freeze = `false`

  * void set_freeze_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_freeze_enabled()

If `true`, the body is frozen. Gravity and forces are not applied anymore.

See freeze_mode to set the body's behavior when frozen.

For a body that is always frozen, use StaticBody3D or AnimatableBody3D
instead.

FreezeMode freeze_mode = `0`

  * void set_freeze_mode(value: FreezeMode)

  * FreezeMode get_freeze_mode()

The body's freeze mode. Can be used to set the body's behavior when freeze is
enabled. See FreezeMode for possible values.

For a body that is always frozen, use StaticBody3D or AnimatableBody3D
instead.

float gravity_scale = `1.0`

  * void set_gravity_scale(value: float)

  * float get_gravity_scale()

This is multiplied by ProjectSettings.physics/3d/default_gravity to produce
this body's gravity. For example, a value of `1.0` will apply normal gravity,
`2.0` will apply double the gravity, and `0.5` will apply half the gravity to
this body.

Vector3 inertia = `Vector3(0, 0, 0)`

  * void set_inertia(value: Vector3)

  * Vector3 get_inertia()

The body's moment of inertia. This is like mass, but for rotation: it
determines how much torque it takes to rotate the body on each axis. The
moment of inertia is usually computed automatically from the mass and the
shapes, but this property allows you to set a custom value.

If set to Vector3.ZERO, inertia is automatically computed (default value).

Note: This value does not change when inertia is automatically computed. Use
PhysicsServer3D to get the computed inertia.

    @onready var ball = $Ball
    
    func get_ball_inertia():
        return PhysicsServer3D.body_get_direct_state(ball.get_rid()).inverse_inertia.inverse()
    
    
    
    private RigidBody3D _ball;
    
    public override void _Ready()
    {
        _ball = GetNode<RigidBody3D>("Ball");

    private Vector3 GetBallInertia()
    {
        return PhysicsServer3D.BodyGetDirectState(_ball.GetRid()).InverseInertia.Inverse();
    }
    

float linear_damp = `0.0`

  * void set_linear_damp(value: float)

  * float get_linear_damp()

Damps the body's movement. By default, the body will use the
ProjectSettings.physics/3d/default_linear_damp project setting or any value
override set by an Area3D the body is in. Depending on linear_damp_mode, you
can set linear_damp to be added to or to replace the body's damping value.

See ProjectSettings.physics/3d/default_linear_damp for more details about
damping.

DampMode linear_damp_mode = `0`

  * void set_linear_damp_mode(value: DampMode)

  * DampMode get_linear_damp_mode()

Defines how linear_damp is applied. See DampMode for possible values.

Vector3 linear_velocity = `Vector3(0, 0, 0)`

  * void set_linear_velocity(value: Vector3)

  * Vector3 get_linear_velocity()

The body's linear velocity in units per second. Can be used sporadically, but
don't set this every frame, because physics may run in another thread and runs
at a different granularity. Use _integrate_forces() as your process loop for
precise control of the body state.

bool lock_rotation = `false`

  * void set_lock_rotation_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_lock_rotation_enabled()

If `true`, the body cannot rotate. Gravity and forces only apply linear
movement.

float mass = `1.0`

  * void set_mass(value: float)

  * float get_mass()

The body's mass.

int max_contacts_reported = `0`

  * void set_max_contacts_reported(value: int)

  * int get_max_contacts_reported()

The maximum number of contacts that will be recorded. Requires a value greater
than 0 and contact_monitor to be set to `true` to start to register contacts.
Use get_contact_count() to retrieve the count or get_colliding_bodies() to
retrieve bodies that have been collided with.

Note: The number of contacts is different from the number of collisions.
Collisions between parallel edges will result in two contacts (one at each
end), and collisions between parallel faces will result in four contacts (one
at each corner).

PhysicsMaterial physics_material_override

  * void set_physics_material_override(value: PhysicsMaterial)

  * PhysicsMaterial get_physics_material_override()

The physics material override for the body.

If a material is assigned to this property, it will be used instead of any
other physics material, such as an inherited one.

bool sleeping = `false`

  * void set_sleeping(value: bool)

  * bool is_sleeping()

If `true`, the body will not move and will not calculate forces until woken up
by another body through, for example, a collision, or by using the
apply_impulse() or apply_force() methods.

## Method Descriptions

void _integrate_forces(state: PhysicsDirectBodyState3D) virtual

Called during physics processing, allowing you to read and safely modify the
simulation state for the object. By default, it is called before the standard
force integration, but the custom_integrator property allows you to disable
the standard force integration and do fully custom force integration for a
body.

void add_constant_central_force(force: Vector3)

Adds a constant directional force without affecting rotation that keeps being
applied over time until cleared with `constant_force = Vector3(0, 0, 0)`.

This is equivalent to using add_constant_force() at the body's center of mass.

void add_constant_force(force: Vector3, position: Vector3 = Vector3(0, 0, 0))

Adds a constant positioned force to the body that keeps being applied over
time until cleared with `constant_force = Vector3(0, 0, 0)`.

`position` is the offset from the body origin in global coordinates.

void add_constant_torque(torque: Vector3)

Adds a constant rotational force without affecting position that keeps being
applied over time until cleared with `constant_torque = Vector3(0, 0, 0)`.

void apply_central_force(force: Vector3)

Applies a directional force without affecting rotation. A force is time
dependent and meant to be applied every physics update.

This is equivalent to using apply_force() at the body's center of mass.

void apply_central_impulse(impulse: Vector3)

Applies a directional impulse without affecting rotation.

An impulse is time-independent! Applying an impulse every frame would result
in a framerate-dependent force. For this reason, it should only be used when
simulating one-time impacts (use the "_force" functions otherwise).

This is equivalent to using apply_impulse() at the body's center of mass.

void apply_force(force: Vector3, position: Vector3 = Vector3(0, 0, 0))

Applies a positioned force to the body. A force is time dependent and meant to
be applied every physics update.

`position` is the offset from the body origin in global coordinates.

void apply_impulse(impulse: Vector3, position: Vector3 = Vector3(0, 0, 0))

Applies a positioned impulse to the body.

An impulse is time-independent! Applying an impulse every frame would result
in a framerate-dependent force. For this reason, it should only be used when
simulating one-time impacts (use the "_force" functions otherwise).

`position` is the offset from the body origin in global coordinates.

void apply_torque(torque: Vector3)

Applies a rotational force without affecting position. A force is time
dependent and meant to be applied every physics update.

Note: inertia is required for this to work. To have inertia, an active
CollisionShape3D must be a child of the node, or you can manually set inertia.

void apply_torque_impulse(impulse: Vector3)

Applies a rotational impulse to the body without affecting the position.

An impulse is time-independent! Applying an impulse every frame would result
in a framerate-dependent force. For this reason, it should only be used when
simulating one-time impacts (use the "_force" functions otherwise).

Note: inertia is required for this to work. To have inertia, an active
CollisionShape3D must be a child of the node, or you can manually set inertia.

Array[Node3D] get_colliding_bodies() const

Returns a list of the bodies colliding with this one. Requires contact_monitor
to be set to `true` and max_contacts_reported to be set high enough to detect
all the collisions.

Note: The result of this test is not immediate after moving objects. For
performance, list of collisions is updated once per frame and before the
physics step. Consider using signals instead.

int get_contact_count() const

Returns the number of contacts this body has with other bodies. By default,
this returns 0 unless bodies are configured to monitor contacts (see
contact_monitor).

Note: To retrieve the colliding bodies, use get_colliding_bodies().

Basis get_inverse_inertia_tensor() const

Returns the inverse inertia tensor basis. This is used to calculate the
angular acceleration resulting from a torque applied to the RigidBody3D.

void set_axis_velocity(axis_velocity: Vector3)

Sets an axis velocity. The velocity in the given vector axis will be set as
the given vector length. This is useful for jumping behavior.
