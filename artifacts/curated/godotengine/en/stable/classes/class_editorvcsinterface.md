# EditorVCSInterface

Inherits: Object

Version Control System (VCS) interface, which reads and writes to the local
VCS in use.

## Description

Defines the API that the editor uses to extract information from the
underlying VCS. The implementation of this API is included in VCS plugins,
which are GDExtension plugins that inherit EditorVCSInterface and are attached
(on demand) to the singleton instance of EditorVCSInterface. Instead of
performing the task themselves, all the virtual functions listed below are
calling the internally overridden functions in the VCS plugins to provide a
plug-n-play experience. A custom VCS plugin is supposed to inherit from
EditorVCSInterface and override each of these virtual functions.

enum TreeArea:

TreeArea TREE_AREA_COMMIT = `0`

## Method Descriptions

bool _checkout_branch(branch_name: String) virtual

Checks out a `branch_name` in the VCS.

void _commit(msg: String) virtual

Commits the currently staged changes and applies the commit `msg` to the
resulting commit.

void _create_branch(branch_name: String) virtual

Creates a new branch named `branch_name` in the VCS.

void _create_remote(remote_name: String, remote_url: String) virtual

Creates a new remote destination with name `remote_name` and points it to
`remote_url`. This can be an HTTPS remote or an SSH remote.

void _discard_file(file_path: String) virtual

Discards the changes made in a file present at `file_path`.

void _fetch(remote: String) virtual

Fetches new changes from the `remote`, but doesn't write changes to the
current working directory. Equivalent to `git fetch`.

Array[String] _get_branch_list() virtual

Gets an instance of an Array of Strings containing available branch names in
the VCS.

String _get_current_branch_name() virtual

Gets the current branch name defined in the VCS.

Array[Dictionary] _get_diff(identifier: String, area: int) virtual

Returns an array of Dictionary items (see create_diff_file(),
create_diff_hunk(), create_diff_line(), add_line_diffs_into_diff_hunk() and
add_diff_hunks_into_diff_file()), each containing information about a diff. If
`identifier` is a file path, returns a file diff, and if it is a commit
identifier, then returns a commit diff.

Array[Dictionary] _get_line_diff(file_path: String, text: String) virtual

Returns an Array of Dictionary items (see create_diff_hunk()), each containing
a line diff between a file at `file_path` and the `text` which is passed in.

Array[Dictionary] _get_modified_files_data() virtual

Returns an Array of Dictionary items (see create_status_file()), each
containing the status data of every modified file in the project folder.

Array[Dictionary] _get_previous_commits(max_commits: int) virtual

Returns an Array of Dictionary items (see create_commit()), each containing
the data for a past commit.

Array[String] _get_remotes() virtual

Returns an Array of Strings, each containing the name of a remote configured
in the VCS.

String _get_vcs_name() virtual

Returns the name of the underlying VCS provider.

bool _initialize(project_path: String) virtual

Initializes the VCS plugin when called from the editor. Returns whether or not
the plugin was successfully initialized. A VCS project is initialized at
`project_path`.

void _pull(remote: String) virtual

Pulls changes from the remote. This can give rise to merge conflicts.

void _push(remote: String, force: bool) virtual

Pushes changes to the `remote`. If `force` is `true`, a force push will
override the change history already present on the remote.

void _remove_branch(branch_name: String) virtual

Remove a branch from the local VCS.

void _remove_remote(remote_name: String) virtual

Remove a remote from the local VCS.

void _set_credentials(username: String, password: String, ssh_public_key_path:
String, ssh_private_key_path: String, ssh_passphrase: String) virtual

Set user credentials in the underlying VCS. `username` and `password` are used
only during HTTPS authentication unless not already mentioned in the remote
URL. `ssh_public_key_path`, `ssh_private_key_path`, and `ssh_passphrase` are
only used during SSH authentication.

bool _shut_down() virtual

Shuts down VCS plugin instance. Called when the user either closes the editor
or shuts down the VCS plugin through the editor UI.

void _stage_file(file_path: String) virtual

Stages the file present at `file_path` to the staged area.

void _unstage_file(file_path: String) virtual

Unstages the file present at `file_path` from the staged area to the unstaged
area.

Dictionary add_diff_hunks_into_diff_file(diff_file: Dictionary, diff_hunks:
Array[Dictionary])

Helper function to add an array of `diff_hunks` into a `diff_file`.

Dictionary add_line_diffs_into_diff_hunk(diff_hunk: Dictionary, line_diffs:
Array[Dictionary])

Helper function to add an array of `line_diffs` into a `diff_hunk`.

Dictionary create_commit(msg: String, author: String, id: String,
unix_timestamp: int, offset_minutes: int)

Helper function to create a commit Dictionary item. `msg` is the commit
message of the commit. `author` is a single human-readable string containing
all the author's details, e.g. the email and name configured in the VCS. `id`
is the identifier of the commit, in whichever format your VCS may provide an
identifier to commits. `unix_timestamp` is the UTC Unix timestamp of when the
commit was created. `offset_minutes` is the timezone offset in minutes,
recorded from the system timezone where the commit was created.

Dictionary create_diff_file(new_file: String, old_file: String)

Helper function to create a Dictionary for storing old and new diff file
paths.

Dictionary create_diff_hunk(old_start: int, new_start: int, old_lines: int,
new_lines: int)

Helper function to create a Dictionary for storing diff hunk data. `old_start`
is the starting line number in old file. `new_start` is the starting line
number in new file. `old_lines` is the number of lines in the old file.
`new_lines` is the number of lines in the new file.

Dictionary create_diff_line(new_line_no: int, old_line_no: int, content:
String, status: String)

Helper function to create a Dictionary for storing a line diff. `new_line_no`
is the line number in the new file (can be `-1` if the line is deleted).
`old_line_no` is the line number in the old file (can be `-1` if the line is
added). `content` is the diff text. `status` is a single character string
which stores the line origin.

Dictionary create_status_file(file_path: String, change_type: ChangeType,
area: TreeArea)

Helper function to create a Dictionary used by editor to read the status of a
file.

void popup_error(msg: String)

Pops up an error message in the editor which is shown as coming from the
underlying VCS. Use this to show VCS specific error messages.
