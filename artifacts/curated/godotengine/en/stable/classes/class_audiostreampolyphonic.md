## Description

AudioStream that lets the user play custom streams at any time from code,
simultaneously using a single player.

Playback control is done via the AudioStreamPlaybackPolyphonic instance set
inside the player, which can be obtained via
AudioStreamPlayer.get_stream_playback(),
AudioStreamPlayer2D.get_stream_playback() or
AudioStreamPlayer3D.get_stream_playback() methods. Obtaining the playback
instance is only valid after the `stream` property is set as an
AudioStreamPolyphonic in those players.
