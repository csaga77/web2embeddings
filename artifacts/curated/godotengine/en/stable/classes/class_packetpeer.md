Abstraction and base class for packet-based protocols.

## Description

PacketPeer is an abstraction and base class for packet-based protocols (such
as UDP). It provides an API for sending and receiving packets both as raw data
or variables. This makes it easy to transfer data over a protocol, without
having to encode data as low-level bytes or having to worry about network
ordering.

Note: When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the `INTERNET` permission
in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click
deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by
Android.

## Property Descriptions

int encode_buffer_max_size = `8388608`

  * void set_encode_buffer_max_size(value: int)

  * int get_encode_buffer_max_size()

Maximum buffer size allowed when encoding Variants. Raise this value to
support heavier memory allocations.

The put_var() method allocates memory on the stack, and the buffer used will
grow automatically to the closest power of two to match the size of the
Variant. If the Variant is bigger than encode_buffer_max_size, the method will
error out with @GlobalScope.ERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY.

## Method Descriptions

int get_available_packet_count() const

Returns the number of packets currently available in the ring-buffer.

PackedByteArray get_packet()

Gets a raw packet.

Error get_packet_error() const

Returns the error state of the last packet received (via get_packet() and
get_var()).

Variant get_var(allow_objects: bool = false)

Gets a Variant. If `allow_objects` is `true`, decoding objects is allowed.

Internally, this uses the same decoding mechanism as the
@GlobalScope.bytes_to_var() method.

Warning: Deserialized objects can contain code which gets executed. Do not use
this option if the serialized object comes from untrusted sources to avoid
potential security threats such as remote code execution.

Error put_packet(buffer: PackedByteArray)

Sends a raw packet.

Error put_var(var: Variant, full_objects: bool = false)

Sends a Variant as a packet. If `full_objects` is `true`, encoding objects is
allowed (and can potentially include code).

Internally, this uses the same encoding mechanism as the
@GlobalScope.var_to_bytes() method.
