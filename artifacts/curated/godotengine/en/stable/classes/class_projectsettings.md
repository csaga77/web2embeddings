# ProjectSettings

Inherits: Object

Stores globally-accessible variables.

## Description

Stores variables that can be accessed from everywhere. Use get_setting(),
set_setting() or has_setting() to access them. Variables stored in
`project.godot` are also loaded into ProjectSettings, making this object very
useful for reading custom game configuration options.

When naming a Project Settings property, use the full path to the setting
including the category. For example, `"application/config/name"` for the
project name. Category and property names can be viewed in the Project
Settings dialog.

Feature tags: Project settings can be overridden for specific platforms and
configurations (debug, release, ...) using feature tags.

Overriding: Any project setting can be overridden by creating a file named
`override.cfg` in the project's root directory. This can also be used in
exported projects by placing this file in the same directory as the project
binary. Overriding will still take the base project settings' feature tags in
account. Therefore, make sure to also override the setting with the desired
feature tags if you want them to override base project settings on all
platforms and configurations.

## Signals

settings_changed()

Emitted when any setting is changed, up to once per process frame.

## Property Descriptions

bool animation/warnings/check_angle_interpolation_type_conflicting = `true`

If `true`, AnimationMixer prints the warning of interpolation being forced to
choose the shortest rotation path due to multiple angle interpolation types
being mixed in the AnimationMixer cache.

bool animation/warnings/check_invalid_track_paths = `true`

If `true`, AnimationMixer prints the warning of no matching object of the
track path in the scene.

Color application/boot_splash/bg_color = `Color(0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 1)`

Background color for the boot splash.

bool application/boot_splash/fullsize = `true`

If `true`, scale the boot splash image to the full window size (preserving the
aspect ratio) when the engine starts. If `false`, the engine will leave it at
the default pixel size.

String application/boot_splash/image = `""`

Path to an image used as the boot splash. If left empty, the default Godot
Engine splash will be displayed instead.

Note: Only effective if application/boot_splash/show_image is `true`.

Note: The only supported format is PNG. Using another image format will result
in an error.

Note: The image will also show when opening the project in the editor. If you
want to display the default splash image in the editor, add an empty override
for `editor_hint` feature.

int application/boot_splash/minimum_display_time = `0`

Minimum boot splash display time (in milliseconds). It is not recommended to
set too high values for this setting.

bool application/boot_splash/show_image = `true`

If `true`, displays the image specified in application/boot_splash/image when
the engine starts. If `false`, only displays the plain color specified in
application/boot_splash/bg_color.

bool application/boot_splash/use_filter = `true`

If `true`, applies linear filtering when scaling the image (recommended for
high-resolution artwork). If `false`, uses nearest-neighbor interpolation
(recommended for pixel art).

bool application/config/auto_accept_quit = `true`

If `true`, the application automatically accepts quitting requests.

String application/config/custom_user_dir_name = `""`

This user directory is used for storing persistent data (`user://`
filesystem). If a custom directory name is defined, this name will be appended
to the system-specific user data directory (same parent folder as the Godot
configuration folder documented in OS.get_user_data_dir()).

The application/config/use_custom_user_dir setting must be enabled for this to
take effect.

Note: If application/config/custom_user_dir_name contains trailing periods,
they will be stripped as folder names ending with a period are not allowed on
Windows.

String application/config/description = `""`

The project's description, displayed as a tooltip in the Project Manager when
hovering the project.

String application/config/icon = `""`

Icon used for the project, set when project loads. Exporters will also use
this icon as a fallback if necessary.

String application/config/macos_native_icon = `""`

Icon set in `.icns` format used on macOS to set the game's icon. This is done
automatically on start by calling DisplayServer.set_native_icon().

String application/config/name = `""`

The project's name. It is used both by the Project Manager and by exporters.
The project name can be translated by translating its value in localization
files. The window title will be set to match the project name automatically on
startup.

Note: Changing this value will also change the user data folder's path if
application/config/use_custom_user_dir is `false`. After renaming the project,
you will no longer be able to access existing data in `user://` unless you
rename the old folder to match the new project name. See Data paths in the
documentation for more information.

Dictionary application/config/name_localized = `{}`

Translations of the project's name. This setting is used by OS tools to
translate application name on Android, iOS and macOS.

String application/config/project_settings_override = `""`

Specifies a file to override project settings. For example:
`user://custom_settings.cfg`. See "Overriding" in the ProjectSettings class
description at the top for more information.

Note: Regardless of this setting's value, `res://override.cfg` will still be
read to override the project settings.

bool application/config/quit_on_go_back = `true`

If `true`, the application quits automatically when navigating back (e.g.
using the system "Back" button on Android).

bool application/config/use_custom_user_dir = `false`

If `true`, the project will save user data to its own user directory. If
application/config/custom_user_dir_name is empty, `<OS user data
directory>/<project name>` directory will be used. If `false`, the project
will save user data to `<OS user data directory>/Godot/app_userdata/<project
name>`.

See also File paths in Godot projects. This setting is only effective on
desktop platforms.

bool application/config/use_hidden_project_data_directory = `true`

If `true`, the project will use a hidden directory (`.godot`) for storing
project-specific data (metadata, shader cache, etc.).

If `false`, a non-hidden directory (`godot`) will be used instead.

Note: Restart the application after changing this setting.

Note: Changing this value can help on platforms or with third-party tools
where hidden directory patterns are disallowed. Only modify this setting if
you know that your environment requires it, as changing the default can impact
compatibility with some external tools or plugins which expect the default
`.godot` folder.

String application/config/version = `""`

The project's human-readable version identifier. This is used by exporters if
the version identifier isn't overridden there. If application/config/version
is an empty string and the version identifier isn't overridden in an exporter,
the exporter will use `1.0.0` as a version identifier.

String application/config/windows_native_icon = `""`

Icon set in `.ico` format used on Windows to set the game's icon. This is done
automatically on start by calling DisplayServer.set_native_icon().

bool application/run/delta_smoothing = `true`

Time samples for frame deltas are subject to random variation introduced by
the platform, even when frames are displayed at regular intervals thanks to
V-Sync. This can lead to jitter. Delta smoothing can often give a better
result by filtering the input deltas to correct for minor fluctuations from
the refresh rate.

Note: Delta smoothing is only attempted when display/window/vsync/vsync_mode
is set to `enabled`, as it does not work well without V-Sync.

It may take several seconds at a stable frame rate before the smoothing is
initially activated. It will only be active on machines where performance is
adequate to render frames at the refresh rate.

bool application/run/disable_stderr = `false`

If `true`, disables printing to standard error. If `true`, this also hides
error and warning messages printed by @GlobalScope.push_error() and
@GlobalScope.push_warning(). See also application/run/disable_stdout.

Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application.
To control this at runtime, use Engine.print_error_messages.

bool application/run/disable_stdout = `false`

If `true`, disables printing to standard output. This is equivalent to
starting the editor or project with the `--quiet` command line argument. See
also application/run/disable_stderr.

Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application.
To control this at runtime, use Engine.print_to_stdout.

bool application/run/enable_alt_space_menu = `false`

If `true`, allows the ``Alt` + `Space`` keys to display the window menu. This
menu allows the user to perform various window management operations such as
moving, resizing, or minimizing the window.

Note: When the menu is displayed, project execution will pause until the menu
is fully closed due to Windows behavior. Consider this when enabling this
setting in a networked multiplayer game. The menu is only considered fully
closed when an option is selected, when the user clicks outside, or when
`Escape` is pressed after bringing up the window menu and another key is
pressed afterwards.

Note: This setting is implemented only on Windows.

bool application/run/flush_stdout_on_print = `false`

If `true`, flushes the standard output stream every time a line is printed.
This affects both terminal logging and file logging.

When running a project, this setting must be enabled if you want logs to be
collected by service managers such as systemd/journalctl. This setting is
disabled by default on release builds, since flushing on every printed line
will negatively affect performance if lots of lines are printed in a rapid
succession. Also, if this setting is enabled, logged files will still be
written successfully if the application crashes or is otherwise killed by the
user (without being closed "normally").

Note: Regardless of this setting, the standard error stream (`stderr`) is
always flushed when a line is printed to it.

Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application.

bool application/run/flush_stdout_on_print.debug = `true`

Debug build override for application/run/flush_stdout_on_print, as performance
is less important during debugging.

Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application.

int application/run/frame_delay_msec = `0`

Forces a constant delay between frames in the main loop (in milliseconds). In
most situations, application/run/max_fps should be preferred as an FPS limiter
as it's more precise.

This setting can be overridden using the `--frame-delay <ms;>` command line
argument.

bool application/run/low_processor_mode = `false`

If `true`, enables low-processor usage mode. When enabled, the engine takes
longer to redraw, but only redraws the screen if necessary. This may lower
power consumption, and is intended for editors or mobile applications. For
most games, because the screen needs to be redrawn every frame, it is
recommended to keep this setting disabled.

int application/run/low_processor_mode_sleep_usec = `6900`

Amount of sleeping between frames when the low-processor usage mode is enabled
(in microseconds). Higher values will result in lower CPU usage.

String application/run/main_loop_type = `"SceneTree"`

The name of the type implementing the engine's main loop.

String application/run/main_scene = `""`

Path to the main scene file that will be loaded when the project runs.

int application/run/max_fps = `0`

Maximum number of frames per second allowed. A value of `0` means "no limit".
The actual number of frames per second may still be below this value if the
CPU or GPU cannot keep up with the project logic and rendering.

Limiting the FPS can be useful to reduce system power consumption, which
reduces heat and noise emissions (and improves battery life on mobile
devices).

If display/window/vsync/vsync_mode is set to `Enabled` or `Adaptive`, it takes
precedence and the forced FPS number cannot exceed the monitor's refresh rate.

If display/window/vsync/vsync_mode is `Enabled`, on monitors with variable
refresh rate enabled (G-Sync/FreeSync), using an FPS limit a few frames lower
than the monitor's refresh rate will reduce input lag while avoiding tearing.

If display/window/vsync/vsync_mode is `Disabled`, limiting the FPS to a high
value that can be consistently reached on the system can reduce input lag
compared to an uncapped framerate. Since this works by ensuring the GPU load
is lower than 100%, this latency reduction is only effective in GPU-
bottlenecked scenarios, not CPU-bottlenecked scenarios.

See also physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second.

This setting can be overridden using the `--max-fps <fps>` command line
argument (including with a value of `0` for unlimited framerate).

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To change the
rendering FPS cap at runtime, set Engine.max_fps instead.

bool application/run/print_header = `true`

If `true`, the engine header is printed in the console on startup. This header
describes the current version of the engine, as well as the renderer being
used. This behavior can also be disabled on the command line with the `--no-
header` option.

float audio/buses/channel_disable_threshold_db = `-60.0`

Audio buses will disable automatically when sound goes below a given dB
threshold for a given time. This saves CPU as effects assigned to that bus
will no longer do any processing.

float audio/buses/channel_disable_time = `2.0`

Audio buses will disable automatically when sound goes below a given dB
threshold for a given time. This saves CPU as effects assigned to that bus
will no longer do any processing.

String audio/buses/default_bus_layout = `"res://default_bus_layout.tres"`

Default AudioBusLayout resource file to use in the project, unless overridden
by the scene.

String audio/driver/driver

Specifies the audio driver to use. This setting is platform-dependent as each
platform supports different audio drivers. If left empty, the default audio
driver will be used.

The `Dummy` audio driver disables all audio playback and recording, which is
useful for non-game applications as it reduces CPU usage. It also prevents the
engine from appearing as an application playing audio in the OS' audio mixer.

To query the value that is being used at run-time (which may be overridden by
command-line arguments or headless mode), use AudioServer.get_driver_name().

Note: The driver in use can be overridden at runtime via the `--audio-driver`
command line argument.

bool audio/driver/enable_input = `false`

If `true`, microphone input will be allowed. This requires appropriate
permissions to be set when exporting to Android or iOS.

Note: If the operating system blocks access to audio input devices (due to the
user's privacy settings), audio capture will only return silence. On Windows
10 and later, make sure that apps are allowed to access the microphone in the
OS' privacy settings.

int audio/driver/mix_rate = `44100`

Target mixing rate used for audio (in Hz). In general, it's better to not
touch this and leave it to the host operating system.

Note: On iOS and macOS, mixing rate is determined by audio driver, this value
is ignored.

Note: Input and output mixing rates might be different. Use
AudioServer.get_mix_rate() and AudioServer.get_input_mix_rate() to get actual
values.

int audio/driver/mix_rate.web = `0`

Safer override for audio/driver/mix_rate in the Web platform. Here `0` means
"let the browser choose" (since some browsers do not like forcing the mix
rate).

int audio/driver/output_latency = `15`

Specifies the preferred output latency in milliseconds for audio. Lower values
will result in lower audio latency at the cost of increased CPU usage. Low
values may result in audible crackling on slower hardware.

Audio output latency may be constrained by the host operating system and audio
hardware drivers. If the host can not provide the specified audio output
latency then Godot will attempt to use the nearest latency allowed by the
host. As such you should always use AudioServer.get_output_latency() to
determine the actual audio output latency.

Audio output latency can be overridden using the `--audio-output-latency <ms>`
command line argument.

Note: This setting is ignored on Android, and on all versions of Windows prior
to Windows 10.

int audio/driver/output_latency.web = `50`

Safer override for audio/driver/output_latency in the Web platform, to avoid
audio issues especially on mobile devices.

float audio/general/2d_panning_strength = `0.5`

The base strength of the panning effect for all AudioStreamPlayer2D nodes. The
panning strength can be further scaled on each Node using
AudioStreamPlayer2D.panning_strength. A value of `0.0` disables stereo panning
entirely, leaving only volume attenuation in place. A value of `1.0`
completely mutes one of the channels if the sound is located exactly to the
left (or right) of the listener.

The default value of `0.5` is tuned for headphones. When using speakers, you
may find lower values to sound better as speakers have a lower stereo
separation compared to headphones.

float audio/general/3d_panning_strength = `0.5`

The base strength of the panning effect for all AudioStreamPlayer3D nodes. The
panning strength can be further scaled on each Node using
AudioStreamPlayer3D.panning_strength. A value of `0.0` disables stereo panning
entirely, leaving only volume attenuation in place. A value of `1.0`
completely mutes one of the channels if the sound is located exactly to the
left (or right) of the listener.

The default value of `0.5` is tuned for headphones. When using speakers, you
may find lower values to sound better as speakers have a lower stereo
separation compared to headphones.

int audio/general/default_playback_type = `0`

Experimental: This property may be changed or removed in future versions.

Specifies the default playback type of the platform.

The default value is set to Stream, as most platforms have no issues mixing
streams.

int audio/general/default_playback_type.web = `1`

Experimental: This property may be changed or removed in future versions.

Specifies the default playback type of the Web platform.

The default value is set to Sample as the Web platform is not suited to mix
audio streams outside of the Web Audio API, especially when exporting a
single-threaded game. Sample allows for lower latency on the web platform at
the cost of flexibility (AudioEffects are not supported).

Warning: Forcing Stream on the Web platform may cause high audio latency and
crackling, especially when exporting a multi-threaded game.

bool audio/general/ios/mix_with_others = `false`

Sets the mixWithOthers option for the AVAudioSession on iOS. This will
override the mix behavior, if the category is set to `Play and Record`,
`Playback`, or `Multi Route`.

`Ambient` always has this set per default.

int audio/general/ios/session_category = `0`

Sets the AVAudioSessionCategory on iOS. Use the `Playback` category to get
sound output, even if the phone is in silent mode.

bool audio/general/text_to_speech = `false`

If `true`, text-to-speech support is enabled, see

Position offset for tooltips, relative to the mouse cursor's hotspot.

bool display/window/dpi/allow_hidpi = `true`

If `true`, allows HiDPI display on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS and Web. If
`false`, the platform's low-DPI fallback will be used on HiDPI displays, which
causes the window to be displayed in a blurry or pixelated manner (and can
cause various window management bugs). Therefore, it is recommended to make
your project scale to multiple resolutions instead of disabling this setting.

Note: This setting has no effect on Linux as DPI-awareness fallbacks are not
supported there.

bool display/window/energy_saving/keep_screen_on = `true`

If `true`, keeps the screen on (even in case of inactivity), so the
screensaver does not take over. Works on desktop and mobile platforms.

bool display/window/frame_pacing/android/enable_frame_pacing = `true`

Enable Swappy for stable frame pacing on Android. Highly recommended.

Note: This option will be forced off when using OpenXR.

int display/window/frame_pacing/android/swappy_mode = `2`

Swappy mode to use. The options are:

  * pipeline_forced_on: Try to honor Engine.max_fps. Pipelining is always on. This is the same behavior as Desktop PC.

  * auto_fps_pipeline_forced_on: Autocalculate max fps. Actual max_fps will be between 0 and Engine.max_fps. While this sounds convenient, beware that Swappy will often downgrade max fps until it finds something that can be met and sustained. That means if your game runs between 40fps and 60fps on a 60hz screen, after some time Swappy will downgrade max fps so that the game renders at perfect 30fps.

  * auto_fps_auto_pipeline: Same as auto_fps_pipeline_forced_on, but if Swappy detects that rendering is very fast (e.g. it takes < 8ms to render on a 60hz screen) Swappy will disable pipelining to minimize input latency. This is the default.

Note: If Engine.max_fps is 0, actual max_fps will considered as to be the
screen's refresh rate (often 60hz, 90hz or 120hz depending on device model and
OS settings).

int display/window/handheld/orientation = `0`

The default screen orientation to use on mobile devices. See ScreenOrientation
for possible values.

Note: When set to a portrait orientation, this project setting does not flip
the project resolution's width and height automatically. Instead, you have to
set display/window/size/viewport_width and display/window/size/viewport_height
accordingly.

bool display/window/ios/allow_high_refresh_rate = `true`

If `true`, iOS devices that support high refresh rate/"ProMotion" will be
allowed to render at up to 120 frames per second.

If `true`, the home indicator is hidden automatically. This only affects iOS
devices without a physical home button.

bool display/window/ios/hide_status_bar = `true`

If `true`, the status bar is hidden while the app is running.

bool display/window/ios/suppress_ui_gesture = `true`

If `true`, it will require two swipes to access iOS UI that uses gestures.

Note: This setting has no effect on the home indicator if
`hide_home_indicator` is `true`.

bool display/window/per_pixel_transparency/allowed = `false`

If `true`, allows per-pixel transparency for the window background. This
affects performance, so leave it on `false` unless you need it. See also
display/window/size/transparent and rendering/viewport/transparent_background.

bool display/window/size/always_on_top = `false`

Forces the main window to be always on top.

Note: This setting is ignored on iOS, Android, and Web.

bool display/window/size/borderless = `false`

Forces the main window to be borderless.

Note: This setting is ignored on iOS, Android, and Web.

bool display/window/size/extend_to_title = `false`

Main window content is expanded to the full size of the window. Unlike a
borderless window, the frame is left intact and can be used to resize the
window, and the title bar is transparent, but has minimize/maximize/close
buttons.

Note: This setting is implemented only on macOS.

Vector2i display/window/size/initial_position = `Vector2i(0, 0)`

Main window initial position (in virtual desktop coordinates), this setting is
used only if display/window/size/initial_position_type is set to "Absolute"
(`0`).

Note: This setting only affects the exported project, or when the project is
run from the command line. In the editor, the value of
EditorSettings.run/window_placement/rect_custom_position is used instead.

int display/window/size/initial_position_type = `1`

Main window initial position.

`0` \- "Absolute", display/window/size/initial_position is used to set window
position.

`1` \- "Primary Screen Center".

`2` \- "Other Screen Center", display/window/size/initial_screen is used to
set the screen.

Note: This setting only affects the exported project, or when the project is
run from the command line. In the editor, the value of
EditorSettings.run/window_placement/rect is used instead.

int display/window/size/initial_screen = `0`

Main window initial screen, this setting is used only if
display/window/size/initial_position_type is set to "Other Screen Center"
(`2`).

Note: This setting only affects the exported project, or when the project is
run from the command line. In the editor, the value of
EditorSettings.run/window_placement/screen is used instead.

int display/window/size/mode = `0`

Main window mode. See WindowMode for possible values and how each mode
behaves.

Note: Game embedding is available only in the "Windowed" mode.

bool display/window/size/no_focus = `false`

Main window can't be focused. No-focus window will ignore all input, except
mouse clicks.

bool display/window/size/resizable = `true`

If `true`, allows the window to be resizable by default.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To change whether
the window is resizable at runtime, set Window.unresizable instead on the root
Window, which can be retrieved using `get_viewport().get_window()`.
Window.unresizable takes the opposite value of this setting.

Note: Certain window managers can be configured to ignore the non-resizable
status of a window. Do not rely on this setting as a guarantee that the window
will never be resizable.

Note: This setting is ignored on iOS.

bool display/window/size/sharp_corners = `false`

If `true`, the main window uses sharp corners by default.

Note: This property is implemented only on Windows (11).

bool display/window/size/transparent = `false`

If `true`, enables a window manager hint that the main window background can
be transparent. This does not make the background actually transparent. For
the background to be transparent, the root viewport must also be made
transparent by enabling rendering/viewport/transparent_background.

Note: To use a transparent splash screen, set application/boot_splash/bg_color
to `Color(0, 0, 0, 0)`.

Note: This setting has no effect if
display/window/per_pixel_transparency/allowed is set to `false`.

int display/window/size/viewport_height = `648`

Sets the game's main viewport height. On desktop platforms, this is also the
initial window height, represented by an indigo-colored rectangle in the 2D
editor. Stretch mode settings also use this as a reference when using the
`canvas_items` or `viewport` stretch modes. See also
display/window/size/viewport_width, display/window/size/window_width_override
and display/window/size/window_height_override.

int display/window/size/viewport_width = `1152`

Sets the game's main viewport width. On desktop platforms, this is also the
initial window width, represented by an indigo-colored rectangle in the 2D
editor. Stretch mode settings also use this as a reference when using the
`canvas_items` or `viewport` stretch modes. See also
display/window/size/viewport_height, display/window/size/window_width_override
and display/window/size/window_height_override.

int display/window/size/window_height_override = `0`

On desktop platforms, overrides the game's initial window height. See also
display/window/size/window_width_override, display/window/size/viewport_width
and display/window/size/viewport_height.

Note: By default, or when set to `0`, the initial window height is the
display/window/size/viewport_height. This setting is ignored on iOS, Android,
and Web.

int display/window/size/window_width_override = `0`

On desktop platforms, overrides the game's initial window width. See also
display/window/size/window_height_override, display/window/size/viewport_width
and display/window/size/viewport_height.

Note: By default, or when set to `0`, the initial window width is the
display/window/size/viewport_width. This setting is ignored on iOS, Android,
and Web.

String display/window/stretch/aspect = `"keep"`

There is currently no description for this property. Please help us by
contributing one!

String display/window/stretch/mode = `"disabled"`

Defines how the base size is stretched to fit the resolution of the window or
screen.

"disabled": No stretching happens. One unit in the scene corresponds to one
pixel on the screen. In this mode, display/window/stretch/aspect has no
effect. Recommended for non-game applications.

"canvas_items": The base size specified in width and height in the project
settings is stretched to cover the whole screen (taking
display/window/stretch/aspect into account). This means that everything is
rendered directly at the target resolution. 3D is unaffected, while in 2D,
there is no longer a 1:1 correspondence between sprite pixels and screen
pixels, which may result in scaling artifacts. Recommended for most games that
don't use a pixel art aesthetic, although it is possible to use this stretch
mode for pixel art games too (especially in 3D).

"viewport": The size of the root Viewport is set precisely to the base size
specified in the Project Settings' Display section. The scene is rendered to
this viewport first. Finally, this viewport is scaled to fit the screen
(taking display/window/stretch/aspect into account). Recommended for games
that use a pixel art aesthetic.

float display/window/stretch/scale = `1.0`

The scale factor multiplier to use for 2D elements. This multiplies the final
scale factor determined by display/window/stretch/mode. If using the Disabled
stretch mode, this scale factor is applied as-is. This can be adjusted to make
the UI easier to read on certain displays.

String display/window/stretch/scale_mode = `"fractional"`

The policy to use to determine the final scale factor for 2D elements. This
affects how display/window/stretch/scale is applied, in addition to the
automatic scale factor determined by display/window/stretch/mode.

"fractional": The scale factor will not be modified.

"integer": The scale factor will be floored to an integer value, which means
that the screen size will always be an integer multiple of the base viewport
size. This provides a crisp pixel art appearance.

Note: When using integer scaling with a stretch mode, resizing the window to
be smaller than the base viewport size will clip the contents. Consider
preventing that by setting Window.min_size to the same value as the base
viewport size defined in display/window/size/viewport_width and
display/window/size/viewport_height.

bool display/window/subwindows/embed_subwindows = `true`

If `true`, subwindows are embedded in the main window (this is also called
single-window mode). Single-window mode can be faster as it does not need to
create a separate window for every popup and tooltip, which can be a slow
operation depending on the operating system and rendering method in use.

If `false`, subwindows are created as separate windows (this is also called
multi-window mode). This allows them to be moved outside the main window and
use native operating system window decorations.

This is equivalent to EditorSettings.interface/editor/single_window_mode in
the editor, except the setting's value is inverted.

int display/window/vsync/vsync_mode = `1`

Sets the V-Sync mode for the main game window. The editor's own V-Sync mode
can be set using EditorSettings.interface/editor/vsync_mode.

See VSyncMode for possible values and how they affect the behavior of your
application.

Depending on the platform and rendering method, the engine will fall back to
Enabled if the desired mode is not supported.

V-Sync can be disabled on the command line using the `--disable-vsync` command
line argument.

Note: The Adaptive and Mailbox V-Sync modes are only supported in the Forward+
and Mobile rendering methods, not Compatibility.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To change the V-Sync
mode at runtime, call DisplayServer.window_set_vsync_mode() instead.

String dotnet/project/assembly_name = `""`

Name of the .NET assembly. This name is used as the name of the `.csproj` and
`.sln` files. By default, it's set to the name of the project
(application/config/name) allowing to change it in the future without
affecting the .NET assembly.

int dotnet/project/assembly_reload_attempts = `3`

Number of times to attempt assembly reloading after rebuilding .NET
assemblies. Effectively also the timeout in seconds to wait for unloading of
script assemblies to finish.

String dotnet/project/solution_directory = `""`

Directory that contains the `.sln` file. By default, the `.sln` files is in
the root of the project directory, next to the `project.godot` and `.csproj`
files.

Changing this value allows setting up a multi-project scenario where there are
multiple `.csproj`. Keep in mind that the Godot project is considered one of
the C# projects in the workspace and it's root directory should contain the
`project.godot` and `.csproj` next to each other.

bool editor/export/convert_text_resources_to_binary = `true`

If `true`, text resource (`tres`) and text scene (`tscn`) files are converted
to their corresponding binary format on export. This decreases file sizes and
speeds up loading slightly.

Note: Because a resource's file extension may change in an exported project,
it is heavily recommended to use @GDScript.load() or ResourceLoader instead of
FileAccess to load resources dynamically.

Note: The project settings file (`project.godot`) will always be converted to
binary on export, regardless of this setting.

int editor/import/atlas_max_width = `2048`

The maximum width to use when importing textures as an atlas. The value will
be rounded to the nearest power of two when used. Use this to prevent imported
textures from growing too large in the other direction.

bool editor/import/reimport_missing_imported_files = `true`

There is currently no description for this property. Please help us by
contributing one!

bool editor/import/use_multiple_threads = `true`

If `true` importing of resources is run on multiple threads.

bool editor/movie_writer/disable_vsync = `false`

If `true`, requests V-Sync to be disabled when writing a movie (similar to
setting display/window/vsync/vsync_mode to Disabled). This can speed up video
writing if the hardware is fast enough to render, encode and save the video at
a framerate higher than the monitor's refresh rate.

Note: editor/movie_writer/disable_vsync has no effect if the operating system
or graphics driver forces V-Sync with no way for applications to disable it.

int editor/movie_writer/fps = `60`

The number of frames per second to record in the video when writing a movie.
Simulation speed will adjust to always match the specified framerate, which
means the engine will appear to run slower at higher editor/movie_writer/fps
values. Certain FPS values will require you to adjust
editor/movie_writer/mix_rate to prevent audio from desynchronizing over time.

This can be specified manually on the command line using the `--fixed-fps
<fps>` command line argument.

int editor/movie_writer/mix_rate = `48000`

The audio mix rate to use in the recorded audio when writing a movie (in Hz).
This can be different from audio/driver/mix_rate, but this value must be
divisible by editor/movie_writer/fps to prevent audio from desynchronizing
over time.

float editor/movie_writer/mjpeg_quality = `0.75`

The JPEG quality to use when writing a video to an AVI file, between `0.01`
and `1.0` (inclusive). Higher `quality` values result in better-looking output
at the cost of larger file sizes. Recommended `quality` values are between
`0.75` and `0.9`. Even at quality `1.0`, JPEG compression remains lossy.

Note: This does not affect the audio quality or writing PNG image sequences.

String editor/movie_writer/movie_file = `""`

The output path for the movie. The file extension determines the MovieWriter
that will be used.

Godot has 2 built-in MovieWriters:

  * AVI container with MJPEG for video and uncompressed audio (`.avi` file extension). Lossy compression, medium file sizes, fast encoding. The lossy compression quality can be adjusted by changing editor/movie_writer/mjpeg_quality. The resulting file can be viewed in most video players, but it must be converted to another format for viewing on the web or by Godot with VideoStreamPlayer. MJPEG does not support transparency. AVI output is currently limited to a file of 4 GB in size at most.

  * PNG image sequence for video and WAV for audio (`.png` file extension). Lossless compression, large file sizes, slow encoding. Designed to be encoded to a video file with another tool such as FFmpeg after recording. Transparency is currently not supported, even if the root viewport is set to be transparent.

If you need to encode to a different format or pipe a stream through third-
party software, you can extend this MovieWriter class to create your own movie
writers.

When using PNG output, the frame number will be appended at the end of the
file name. It starts from 0 and is padded with 8 digits to ensure correct
sorting and easier processing. For example, if the output path is
`/tmp/hello.png`, the first two frames will be `/tmp/hello00000000.png` and
`/tmp/hello00000001.png`. The audio will be saved at `/tmp/hello.wav`.

int editor/movie_writer/speaker_mode = `0`

The speaker mode to use in the recorded audio when writing a movie. See
SpeakerMode for possible values.

String editor/naming/default_signal_callback_name =
`"_on_{node_name}_{signal_name}"`

The format of the default signal callback name (in the Signal Connection
Dialog). The following substitutions are available: `{NodeName}`,
`{nodeName}`, `{node_name}`, `{SignalName}`, `{signalName}`, and
`{signal_name}`.

String editor/naming/default_signal_callback_to_self_name =
`"_on_{signal_name}"`

The format of the default signal callback name when a signal connects to the
same node that emits it (in the Signal Connection Dialog). The following
substitutions are available: `{NodeName}`, `{nodeName}`, `{node_name}`,
`{SignalName}`, `{signalName}`, and `{signal_name}`.

int editor/naming/node_name_casing = `0`

When creating node names automatically, set the type of casing to use in this
project. This is mostly an editor setting.

int editor/naming/node_name_num_separator = `0`

What to use to separate node name from number. This is mostly an editor
setting.

int editor/naming/scene_name_casing = `2`

When generating scene file names from scene root node, set the type of casing
to use in this project. This is mostly an editor setting.

int editor/naming/script_name_casing = `0`

When generating script file names from the selected node, set the type of
casing to use in this project. This is mostly an editor setting.

String editor/run/main_run_args = `""`

The command-line arguments to append to Godot's own command line when running
the project. This doesn't affect the editor itself.

It is possible to make another executable run Godot by using the `%command%`
placeholder. The placeholder will be replaced with Godot's own command line.
Program-specific arguments should be placed before the placeholder, whereas
Godot-specific arguments should be placed after the placeholder.

For example, this can be used to force the project to run on the dedicated GPU
in an NVIDIA Optimus system on Linux:

    
    
    prime-run %command%
    

PackedStringArray editor/script/search_in_file_extensions

Text-based file extensions to include in the script editor's "Find in Files"
feature. You can add e.g. `tscn` if you wish to also parse your scene files,
especially if you use built-in scripts which are serialized in the scene
files.

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedStringArray for more details.

String editor/script/templates_search_path = `"res://script_templates"`

Search path for project-specific script templates. Godot will search for
script templates both in the editor-specific path and in this project-specific
path.

bool editor/version_control/autoload_on_startup = `false`

There is currently no description for this property. Please help us by
contributing one!

String editor/version_control/plugin_name = `""`

There is currently no description for this property. Please help us by

bool filesystem/import/blender/enabled = `true`

If `true`, Blender 3D scene files with the `.blend` extension will be imported
by converting them to glTF 2.0.

This requires configuring a path to a Blender executable in the editor
settings at `filesystem/import/blender/blender_path`. Blender 3.0 or later is
required.

bool filesystem/import/blender/enabled.android = `false`

Override for filesystem/import/blender/enabled on Android where Blender can't
easily be accessed from Godot.

bool filesystem/import/blender/enabled.web = `false`

Override for filesystem/import/blender/enabled on the Web where Blender can't
easily be accessed from Godot.

bool filesystem/import/fbx2gltf/enabled = `true`

If `true`, Autodesk FBX 3D scene files with the `.fbx` extension will be
imported by converting them to glTF 2.0.

This requires configuring a path to an FBX2glTF executable in the editor
settings at EditorSettings.filesystem/import/fbx/fbx2gltf_path.

bool filesystem/import/fbx2gltf/enabled.android = `false`

Override for filesystem/import/fbx2gltf/enabled on Android where FBX2glTF
can't easily be accessed from Godot.

bool filesystem/import/fbx2gltf/enabled.web = `false`

Override for filesystem/import/fbx2gltf/enabled on the Web where FBX2glTF
can't easily be accessed from Godot.

int gui/common/default_scroll_deadzone = `0`

Default value for ScrollContainer.scroll_deadzone, which will be used for all
ScrollContainers unless overridden.

bool gui/common/snap_controls_to_pixels = `true`

If `true`, snaps Control node vertices to the nearest pixel to ensure they
remain crisp even when the camera moves or zooms.

bool gui/common/swap_cancel_ok

If `true`, swaps Cancel and OK buttons in dialogs on Windows to follow
interface conventions. DisplayServer.get_swap_cancel_ok() can be used to query
whether buttons are swapped at run-time.

Note: This doesn't affect native dialogs such as the ones spawned by
DisplayServer.dialog_show().

int gui/common/text_edit_undo_stack_max_size = `1024`

Maximum undo/redo history size for TextEdit fields.

bool gui/fonts/dynamic_fonts/use_oversampling = `true`

There is currently no description for this property. Please help us by
contributing one!

String gui/theme/custom = `""`

Path to a custom Theme resource file to use for the project (`.theme` or
generic `.tres`/`.res` extension).

String gui/theme/custom_font = `""`

Path to a custom Font resource to use as default for all GUI elements of the
project.

int gui/theme/default_font_antialiasing = `1`

Font anti-aliasing mode for the default project font. See
FontFile.antialiasing.

Note: This setting does not affect custom Fonts used within the project. Use
the Import dock for that instead (see
ResourceImporterDynamicFont.antialiasing).

bool gui/theme/default_font_generate_mipmaps = `false`

If set to `true`, the default font will have mipmaps generated. This prevents
text from looking grainy when a Control is scaled down, or when a Label3D is
viewed from a long distance (if Label3D.texture_filter is set to a mode that
displays mipmaps).

Enabling gui/theme/default_font_generate_mipmaps increases font generation
time and memory usage. Only enable this setting if you actually need it.

Note: This setting does not affect custom Fonts used within the project. Use
the Import dock for that instead (see
ResourceImporterDynamicFont.generate_mipmaps).

int gui/theme/default_font_hinting = `1`

Font hinting mode for the default project font. See FontFile.hinting.

Note: This setting does not affect custom Fonts used within the project. Use
the Import dock for that instead (see ResourceImporterDynamicFont.hinting).

bool gui/theme/default_font_multichannel_signed_distance_field = `false`

If set to `true`, the default font will use multichannel signed distance field
(MSDF) for crisp rendering at any size. Since this approach does not rely on
rasterizing the font every time its size changes, this allows for resizing the
font in real-time without any performance penalty. Text will also not look
grainy for Controls that are scaled down (or for Label3Ds viewed from a long
distance).

MSDF font rendering can be combined with
gui/theme/default_font_generate_mipmaps to further improve font rendering
quality when scaled down.

Note: This setting does not affect custom Fonts used within the project. Use
the Import dock for that instead (see
ResourceImporterDynamicFont.multichannel_signed_distance_field).

int gui/theme/default_font_subpixel_positioning = `1`

Font glyph subpixel positioning mode for the default project font. See
FontFile.subpixel_positioning.

Note: This setting does not affect custom Fonts used within the project. Use
the Import dock for that instead (see
ResourceImporterDynamicFont.subpixel_positioning).

float gui/theme/default_theme_scale = `1.0`

The default scale factor for Controls, when not overridden by a Theme.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To change the
default scale at runtime, set ThemeDB.fallback_base_scale instead.

int gui/theme/lcd_subpixel_layout = `1`

LCD subpixel layout used for font anti-aliasing. See FontLCDSubpixelLayout.

float gui/timers/button_shortcut_feedback_highlight_time = `0.2`

When BaseButton.shortcut_feedback is enabled, this is the time the BaseButton
will remain highlighted after a shortcut.

int gui/timers/incremental_search_max_interval_msec = `2000`

Timer setting for incremental search in Tree, ItemList, etc. controls (in
milliseconds).

float gui/timers/text_edit_idle_detect_sec = `3`

Timer for detecting idle in TextEdit (in seconds).

float gui/timers/tooltip_delay_sec = `0.5`

Default delay for tooltips (in seconds).

float gui/timers/tooltip_delay_sec.editor_hint = `0.5`

Delay for tooltips in the editor.

bool input_devices/buffering/agile_event_flushing = `false`

If `true`, key/touch/joystick events will be flushed just before every idle
and physics frame.

If `false`, such events will be flushed only once per process frame, between
iterations of the engine.

Enabling this can greatly improve the responsiveness to input, specially in
devices that need to run multiple physics frames per visible (process) frame,
because they can't run at the target frame rate.

Note: Currently implemented only on Android.

bool input_devices/compatibility/legacy_just_pressed_behavior = `false`

If `true`, Input.is_action_just_pressed() and Input.is_action_just_released()
will only return `true` if the action is still in the respective state, i.e.
an action that is pressed and released on the same frame will be missed.

If `false`, no input will be lost.

Note: You should in nearly all cases prefer the `false` setting. The legacy
behavior is to enable supporting old projects that rely on the old logic,
without changes to script.

language. If left empty, `en` (English) will be used.

Note: Not to be confused with TextServerFallback.

bool internationalization/locale/include_text_server_data = `false`

If `true`, text server break iteration rule sets, dictionaries and other
optional data are included in the exported project.

Note: "ICU / HarfBuzz / Graphite" text server data includes dictionaries for
Burmese, Chinese, Japanese, Khmer, Lao and Thai as well as Unicode Standard
Annex #29 and Unicode Standard Annex #14 word and line breaking rules. Data is
about 4 MB large.

Note: TextServerFallback does not use additional data.

String internationalization/locale/test = `""`

If non-empty, this locale will be used instead of the automatically detected
system locale.

Note: This setting also applies to the exported project. To only affect
testing within the editor, override this setting with an `editor` feature tag
for localization testing purposes.

bool internationalization/pseudolocalization/double_vowels = `false`

Double vowels in strings during pseudolocalization to simulate the lengthening
of text due to localization.

float internationalization/pseudolocalization/expansion_ratio = `0.0`

The expansion ratio to use during pseudolocalization. A value of `0.3` is
sufficient for most practical purposes, and will increase the length of each
string by 30%.

bool internationalization/pseudolocalization/fake_bidi = `false`

If `true`, emulate bidirectional (right-to-left) text when pseudolocalization
is enabled. This can be used to spot issues with RTL layout and UI mirroring
that will crop up if the project is localized to RTL languages such as Arabic
or Hebrew. See also
internationalization/rendering/force_right_to_left_layout_direction.

bool internationalization/pseudolocalization/override = `false`

Replace all characters in the string with `*`. Useful for finding non-
localizable strings.

pseudolocalization. Useful to identify strings which need additional control
characters to display correctly.

String internationalization/pseudolocalization/suffix = `"]"`

Suffix that will be appended to the pseudolocalized string.

bool internationalization/pseudolocalization/use_pseudolocalization = `false`

If `true`, enables pseudolocalization for the project. This can be used to
spot untranslatable strings or layout issues that may occur once the project
is localized to languages that have longer strings than the source language.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To toggle
pseudolocalization at run-time, use
TranslationServer.pseudolocalization_enabled instead.

bool internationalization/rendering/force_right_to_left_layout_direction =
`false`

Force layout direction and text writing direction to RTL for all controls,
even if the current locale is intended to use a left-to-right layout and text
writing direction. This should be enabled for testing purposes only. See also
internationalization/pseudolocalization/fake_bidi.

bool internationalization/rendering/root_node_auto_translate = `true`

If `true`, root node will use Node.AUTO_TRANSLATE_MODE_ALWAYS, otherwise
Node.AUTO_TRANSLATE_MODE_DISABLED will be used.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To change the auto
translate mode at runtime, set Node.auto_translate_mode of SceneTree.root
instead.

int internationalization/rendering/root_node_layout_direction = `0`

Root node default layout direction.

String internationalization/rendering/text_driver = `""`

Specifies the TextServer to use. If left empty, the default will be used.

"ICU / HarfBuzz / Graphite" (TextServerAdvanced) is the most advanced text
driver, supporting right-to-left typesetting and complex scripts (for
languages like Arabic, Hebrew, etc.). The "Fallback" text driver
(TextServerFallback) does not support right-to-left typesetting and complex
scripts.

Note: The driver in use can be overridden at runtime via the `--text-driver`
command line argument.

Note: There is an additional `Dummy` text driver available, which disables all
text rendering and font-related functionality. This driver is not listed in
the project settings, but it can be enabled when running the editor or project
using the `--text-driver Dummy` command line argument.

for extra data copies prepared for each thread. A value of `-1` means
unlimited and the maximum available OS processor count is used. Defaults to
`1` when the OS does not support threads.

bool navigation/world/map_use_async_iterations = `true`

If enabled, navigation map synchronization uses an async process that runs on
a background thread. This avoids stalling the main thread but adds an
additional delay to any navigation map change.

int network/limits/debugger/max_chars_per_second = `32768`

Maximum number of characters allowed to send as output from the debugger. Over
this value, content is dropped. This helps not to stall the debugger
connection.

int network/limits/debugger/max_errors_per_second = `400`

Maximum number of errors allowed to be sent from the debugger. Over this
value, content is dropped. This helps not to stall the debugger connection.

int network/limits/debugger/max_queued_messages = `2048`

Maximum number of messages in the debugger queue. Over this value, content is
dropped. This helps to limit the debugger memory usage.

int network/limits/debugger/max_warnings_per_second = `400`

Maximum number of warnings allowed to be sent from the debugger. Over this
value, content is dropped. This helps not to stall the debugger connection.

int network/limits/packet_peer_stream/max_buffer_po2 = `16`

Default size of packet peer stream for deserializing Godot data (in bytes,
specified as a power of two). The default value `16` is equal to 65,536 bytes.
Over this size, data is dropped.

int network/limits/tcp/connect_timeout_seconds = `30`

Timeout (in seconds) for connection attempts using TCP.

int network/limits/webrtc/max_channel_in_buffer_kb = `64`

Maximum size (in kiB) for the WebRTCDataChannel input buffer.

String network/tls/certificate_bundle_override = `""`

The CA certificates bundle to use for TLS connections. If this is set to a
non-empty value, this will override Godot's default Mozilla certificate
bundle. If left empty, the default certificate bundle will be used.

If in doubt, leave this setting empty.

bool network/tls/enable_tls_v1.3 = `true`

If `true`, enable TLSv1.3 negotiation.

Note: Only supported when using Mbed TLS 3.0 or later (Linux distribution
packages may be compiled against older system Mbed TLS packages), otherwise
the maximum supported TLS version is always TLSv1.2.

float physics/2d/default_angular_damp = `1.0`

The default rotational motion damping in 2D. Damping is used to gradually slow
down physical objects over time. RigidBodies will fall back to this value when
combining their own damping values and no area damping value is present.

Suggested values are in the range `0` to `30`. At value `0` objects will keep
moving with the same velocity. Greater values will stop the object faster. A
value equal to or greater than the physics tick rate
(physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second) will bring the object to a stop in
one iteration.

Note: Godot damping calculations are velocity-dependent, meaning bodies moving
faster will take a longer time to come to rest. They do not simulate inertia,
friction, or air resistance. Therefore heavier or larger bodies will lose
speed at the same proportional rate as lighter or smaller bodies.

During each physics tick, Godot will multiply the linear velocity of
RigidBodies by `1.0 - combined_damp / physics_ticks_per_second`. By default,
bodies combine damp factors: `combined_damp` is the sum of the damp value of
the body and this value or the area's value the body is in. See DampMode.

Warning: Godot's damping calculations are simulation tick rate dependent.
Changing physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second may significantly change the
outcomes and feel of your simulation. This is true for the entire range of
damping values greater than 0. To get back to a similar feel, you also need to
change your damp values. This needed change is not proportional and differs
from case to case.

float physics/2d/default_gravity = `980.0`

The default gravity strength in 2D (in pixels per second squared).

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To change the
default gravity at runtime, use the following code sample:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    # Set the default gravity strength to 980.
    PhysicsServer2D.area_set_param(get_viewport().find_world_2d().space, PhysicsServer2D.AREA_PARAM_GRAVITY, 980)
    
    
    
    // Set the default gravity strength to 980.
    PhysicsServer2D.AreaSetParam(GetViewport().FindWorld2D().Space, PhysicsServer2D.AreaParameter.Gravity, 980);
    

Vector2 physics/2d/default_gravity_vector = `Vector2(0, 1)`

The default gravity direction in 2D.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To change the
default gravity vector at runtime, use the following code sample:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    # Set the default gravity direction to `Vector2(0, 1)`.
    PhysicsServer2D.area_set_param(get_viewport().find_world_2d().space, PhysicsServer2D.AREA_PARAM_GRAVITY_VECTOR, Vector2.DOWN)
    
    
    
    // Set the default gravity direction to `Vector2(0, 1)`.
    PhysicsServer2D.AreaSetParam(GetViewport().FindWorld2D().Space, PhysicsServer2D.AreaParameter.GravityVector, Vector2.Down)
    

float physics/2d/default_linear_damp = `0.1`

The default linear motion damping in 2D. Damping is used to gradually slow
down physical objects over time. RigidBodies will fall back to this value when
combining their own damping values and no area damping value is present.

Suggested values are in the range `0` to `30`. At value `0` objects will keep
moving with the same velocity. Greater values will stop the object faster. A
value equal to or greater than the physics tick rate
(physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second) will bring the object to a stop in
one iteration.

Note: Godot damping calculations are velocity-dependent, meaning bodies moving
faster will take a longer time to come to rest. They do not simulate inertia,
friction, or air resistance. Therefore heavier or larger bodies will lose
speed at the same proportional rate as lighter or smaller bodies.

During each physics tick, Godot will multiply the linear velocity of
RigidBodies by `1.0 - combined_damp / physics_ticks_per_second`, where
`combined_damp` is the sum of the linear damp of the body and this value, or
the area's value the body is in, assuming the body defaults to combine damp
values. See DampMode.

Warning: Godot's damping calculations are simulation tick rate dependent.
Changing physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second may significantly change the
outcomes and feel of your simulation. This is true for the entire range of
damping values greater than 0. To get back to a similar feel, you also need to
change your damp values. This needed change is not proportional and differs
from case to case.

String physics/2d/physics_engine = `"DEFAULT"`

DEFAULT is currently equivalent to GodotPhysics2D, but may change in future
releases. Select an explicit implementation if you want to ensure that your
project stays on the same engine.

GodotPhysics2D is Godot's internal 2D physics engine.

Dummy is a 2D physics server that does nothing and returns only dummy values,
effectively disabling all 2D physics functionality.

Third-party extensions and modules can add other physics engines to select
with this setting.

bool physics/2d/run_on_separate_thread = `false`

If `true`, the 2D physics server runs on a separate thread, making better use
of multi-core CPUs. If `false`, the 2D physics server runs on the main thread.
Running the physics server on a separate thread can increase performance, but
restricts API access to only physics process.

float physics/2d/sleep_threshold_angular = `0.139626`

Threshold angular velocity under which a 2D physics body will be considered
inactive. See
PhysicsServer2D.SPACE_PARAM_BODY_ANGULAR_VELOCITY_SLEEP_THRESHOLD.

float physics/2d/solver/default_constraint_bias = `0.2`

Default solver bias for all physics constraints. Defines how much bodies react
to enforce constraints. See
PhysicsServer2D.SPACE_PARAM_CONSTRAINT_DEFAULT_BIAS.

Individual constraints can have a specific bias value (see Joint2D.bias).

float physics/2d/solver/default_contact_bias = `0.8`

Default solver bias for all physics contacts. Defines how much bodies react to
enforce contact separation. See
PhysicsServer2D.SPACE_PARAM_CONTACT_DEFAULT_BIAS.

Individual shapes can have a specific bias value (see
Shape2D.custom_solver_bias).

int physics/2d/solver/solver_iterations = `16`

Number of solver iterations for all contacts and constraints. The greater the
number of iterations, the more accurate the collisions will be. However, a
greater number of iterations requires more CPU power, which can decrease
performance. See PhysicsServer2D.SPACE_PARAM_SOLVER_ITERATIONS.

float physics/2d/time_before_sleep = `0.5`

Time (in seconds) of inactivity before which a 2D physics body will put to
sleep. See PhysicsServer2D.SPACE_PARAM_BODY_TIME_TO_SLEEP.

float physics/3d/default_angular_damp = `0.1`

The default rotational motion damping in 3D. Damping is used to gradually slow
down physical objects over time. RigidBodies will fall back to this value when
combining their own damping values and no area damping value is present.

Suggested values are in the range `0` to `30`. At value `0` objects will keep
moving with the same velocity. Greater values will stop the object faster. A
value equal to or greater than the physics tick rate

change your damp values. This needed change is not proportional and differs
from case to case.

float physics/3d/default_gravity = `9.8`

The default gravity strength in 3D (in meters per second squared).

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To change the
default gravity at runtime, use the following code sample:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    # Set the default gravity strength to 9.8.
    PhysicsServer3D.area_set_param(get_viewport().find_world_3d().space, PhysicsServer3D.AREA_PARAM_GRAVITY, 9.8)
    
    
    
    // Set the default gravity strength to 9.8.
    PhysicsServer3D.AreaSetParam(GetViewport().FindWorld3D().Space, PhysicsServer3D.AreaParameter.Gravity, 9.8);
    

Vector3 physics/3d/default_gravity_vector = `Vector3(0, -1, 0)`

The default gravity direction in 3D.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To change the
default gravity vector at runtime, use the following code sample:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    # Set the default gravity direction to `Vector3(0, -1, 0)`.

Sets which physics engine to use for 3D physics.

DEFAULT is currently equivalent to GodotPhysics3D, but may change in future
releases. Select an explicit implementation if you want to ensure that your
project stays on the same engine.

GodotPhysics3D is Godot's internal 3D physics engine.

Jolt Physics is an alternative physics engine that is generally faster and
more reliable than GodotPhysics3D. As it was recently implemented, it is
currently considered experimental and its behavior may change in future
releases.

Dummy is a 3D physics server that does nothing and returns only dummy values,
effectively disabling all 3D physics functionality.

Third-party extensions and modules can add other physics engines to select
with this setting.

bool physics/3d/run_on_separate_thread = `false`

If `true`, the 3D physics server runs on a separate thread, making better use
of multi-core CPUs. If `false`, the 3D physics server runs on the main thread.
Running the physics server on a separate thread can increase performance, but
restricts API access to only physics process.

Note: When physics/3d/physics_engine is set to `Jolt Physics`, enabling this
setting will prevent the 3D physics server from being able to provide any
context when reporting errors and warnings, and will instead always refer to
nodes as `<unknown>`.

float physics/3d/sleep_threshold_angular = `0.139626`

Threshold angular velocity under which a 3D physics body will be considered
inactive. See
PhysicsServer3D.SPACE_PARAM_BODY_ANGULAR_VELOCITY_SLEEP_THRESHOLD.

float physics/3d/sleep_threshold_linear = `0.1`

Threshold linear velocity under which a 3D physics body will be considered
inactive. See
PhysicsServer3D.SPACE_PARAM_BODY_LINEAR_VELOCITY_SLEEP_THRESHOLD.

float physics/3d/solver/contact_max_allowed_penetration = `0.01`

Maximum distance a shape can penetrate another shape before it is considered a
collision. See PhysicsServer3D.SPACE_PARAM_CONTACT_MAX_ALLOWED_PENETRATION.

float physics/3d/solver/contact_max_separation = `0.05`

Maximum distance a shape can be from another before they are considered
separated and the contact is discarded. See
PhysicsServer3D.SPACE_PARAM_CONTACT_MAX_SEPARATION.

float physics/3d/solver/contact_recycle_radius = `0.01`

Maximum distance a pair of bodies has to move before their collision status
has to be recalculated. See
PhysicsServer3D.SPACE_PARAM_CONTACT_RECYCLE_RADIUS.

float physics/3d/solver/default_contact_bias = `0.8`

Default solver bias for all physics contacts. Defines how much bodies react to
enforce contact separation. See
PhysicsServer3D.SPACE_PARAM_CONTACT_DEFAULT_BIAS.

Individual shapes can have a specific bias value (see
Shape3D.custom_solver_bias).

int physics/3d/solver/solver_iterations = `16`

Number of solver iterations for all contacts and constraints. The greater the
number of iterations, the more accurate the collisions will be. However, a
greater number of iterations requires more CPU power, which can decrease
performance. See PhysicsServer3D.SPACE_PARAM_SOLVER_ITERATIONS.

float physics/3d/time_before_sleep = `0.5`

Time (in seconds) of inactivity before which a 3D physics body will put to
sleep. See PhysicsServer3D.SPACE_PARAM_BODY_TIME_TO_SLEEP.

bool physics/common/enable_object_picking = `true`

Enables Viewport.physics_object_picking on the root viewport.

int physics/common/max_physics_steps_per_frame = `8`

Controls the maximum number of physics steps that can be simulated each
rendered frame. The default value is tuned to avoid "spiral of death"
situations where expensive physics simulations trigger more expensive
simulations indefinitely. However, the game will appear to slow down if the
rendering FPS is less than `1 / max_physics_steps_per_frame` of
physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second. This occurs even if `delta` is
consistently used in physics calculations. To avoid this, increase
physics/common/max_physics_steps_per_frame if you have increased
physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second significantly above its default value.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To change the
maximum number of simulated physics steps per frame at runtime, set
Engine.max_physics_steps_per_frame instead.

bool physics/common/physics_interpolation = `false`

If `true`, the renderer will interpolate the transforms of physics objects
between the last two transforms, so that smooth motion is seen even when
physics ticks do not coincide with rendered frames. See also
Node.physics_interpolation_mode and Node.reset_physics_interpolation().

Note: If `true`, the physics jitter fix should be disabled by setting
physics/common/physics_jitter_fix to `0.0`.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To toggle physics
interpolation at runtime, set SceneTree.physics_interpolation instead.

float physics/common/physics_jitter_fix = `0.5`

Controls how much physics ticks are synchronized with real time. For 0 or
less, the ticks are synchronized. Such values are recommended for network
games, where clock synchronization matters. Higher values cause higher
deviation of in-game clock and real clock, but allows smoothing out framerate
jitters. The default value of 0.5 should be good enough for most; values above
2 could cause the game to react to dropped frames with a noticeable delay and
are not recommended.

Note: Jitter fix is automatically disabled at runtime when
physics/common/physics_interpolation is enabled.

Note: When using a custom physics interpolation solution, the physics jitter
fix should be disabled by setting physics/common/physics_jitter_fix to `0.0`.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To change the
physics jitter fix at runtime, set Engine.physics_jitter_fix instead.

int physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second = `60`

The number of fixed iterations per second. This controls how often physics
simulation and Node._physics_process() methods are run. See also
application/run/max_fps.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To change the
physics FPS at runtime, set Engine.physics_ticks_per_second instead.

Note: Only physics/common/max_physics_steps_per_frame physics ticks may be
simulated per rendered frame at most. If more physics ticks have to be
simulated per rendered frame to keep up with rendering, the project will
appear to slow down (even if `delta` is used consistently in physics
calculations). Therefore, it is recommended to also increase
physics/common/max_physics_steps_per_frame if increasing
physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second significantly above its default value.

float physics/jolt_physics_3d/collisions/active_edge_threshold = `0.872665`

The maximum angle, in radians, between two adjacent triangles in a
ConcavePolygonShape3D or HeightMapShape3D for which the edge between those
triangles is considered inactive.

Collisions against an inactive edge will have its normal overridden to instead
be the surface normal of the triangle. This can help alleviate ghost
collisions.

Note: Setting this too high can result in objects not depenetrating properly.

Note: This applies to all shape queries, as well as physics bodies within the
simulation.

Note: This does not apply when enabling Jolt's enhanced internal edge removal,
which supersedes this.

Note: This setting will only be read once during the lifetime of the
application.

float physics/jolt_physics_3d/collisions/collision_margin_fraction = `0.08`

The amount of collision margin to use for certain convex collision shapes,
such as BoxShape3D, CylinderShape3D and ConvexPolygonShape3D, as a fraction of
the shape's shortest axis, with Shape3D.margin as the upper bound. This is
mainly used to speed up collision detection with convex shapes.

Note: Collision margins in Jolt do not add any extra size to the shape.
Instead the shape is first shrunk by the margin and then expanded by the same
amount, resulting in a shape with rounded corners.

Note: Setting this value too close to `0.0` may also negatively affect the
accuracy of the collision detection with convex shapes.

Note: This setting will only be read once during the lifetime of the
application.

int physics/jolt_physics_3d/joints/world_node = `0`

Which of the two nodes bound by a joint should represent the world when one of
the two is omitted, as either Joint3D.node_a or Joint3D.node_b. This can be
thought of as having the omitted node be a StaticBody3D at the joint's
position. Joint limits are more easily expressed when Joint3D.node_a
represents the world.

Note: In Godot Physics, only Joint3D.node_b can represent the world.

float physics/jolt_physics_3d/limits/max_angular_velocity = `47.1239`

The maximum angular velocity that a RigidBody3D can reach, in radians per
second.

This is mainly used as a fail-safe, to prevent the simulation from exploding,
as fast-moving objects colliding with complex physics structures can otherwise
cause them to go out of control. Fast-moving objects can also cause a lot of
stress on the collision detection system, which can slow down the simulation
considerably.

int physics/jolt_physics_3d/limits/max_bodies = `10240`

The maximum number of PhysicsBody3D to support at the same time, awake or
sleeping. When this limit is exceeded, an error is reported and anything past
that point is undefined behavior.

Note: This limit also applies within the editor.

int physics/jolt_physics_3d/limits/max_body_pairs = `65536`

The maximum number of body pairs to allow processing of. When this limit is
exceeded, a warning is reported and collisions will randomly be ignored while
bodies pass through each other.

int physics/jolt_physics_3d/limits/max_contact_constraints = `20480`

The maximum number of contact constraints to allow processing of. When this
limit is exceeded, a warning is reported and collisions will randomly be
ignored while bodies pass through each other.

float physics/jolt_physics_3d/limits/max_linear_velocity = `500.0`

The maximum linear velocity that a RigidBody3D can reach, in meters per
second.

This is mainly used as a fail-safe, to prevent the simulation from exploding,
as fast-moving objects colliding with complex physics structures can otherwise
cause them to go out of control. Fast-moving objects can also cause a lot of
stress on the collision detection system, which can slow down the simulation
considerably.

int physics/jolt_physics_3d/limits/temporary_memory_buffer_size = `32`

The amount of memory to pre-allocate for the stack allocator used within Jolt,
in MiB. This allocator is used within the physics step to store things that
are only needed during it, like which bodies are in contact, how they form
islands and the data needed to solve the contacts.

float physics/jolt_physics_3d/limits/world_boundary_shape_size = `2000.0`

The size of WorldBoundaryShape3D boundaries, for all three dimensions. The
plane is effectively centered within a box of this size, and anything outside
of the box will not collide with it. This is necessary as WorldBoundaryShape3D
is not unbounded when using Jolt, in order to prevent precision issues.

Note: Setting this value too high can make collision detection less accurate.

Note: Collisions against the effective edges of a WorldBoundaryShape3D will be
inconsistent.

float physics/jolt_physics_3d/motion_queries/recovery_amount = `0.4`

Fraction of the total penetration to depenetrate per iteration during motion
queries.

Note: This affects methods CharacterBody3D.move_and_slide(),
PhysicsBody3D.move_and_collide(), PhysicsBody3D.test_move() and
PhysicsServer3D.body_test_motion().

Note: This setting will only be read once during the lifetime of the
application.

int physics/jolt_physics_3d/motion_queries/recovery_iterations = `4`

The number of iterations to run when depenetrating during motion queries.

Note: This affects methods CharacterBody3D.move_and_slide(),
PhysicsBody3D.move_and_collide(), PhysicsBody3D.test_move() and
PhysicsServer3D.body_test_motion().

Note: This setting will only be read once during the lifetime of the
application.

bool physics/jolt_physics_3d/motion_queries/use_enhanced_internal_edge_removal
= `true`

If `true`, enables Jolt's enhanced internal edge removal during motion
queries. This can help alleviate ghost collisions, but only with edges within
a single body, meaning edges between separate bodies can still cause ghost
collisions.

Note: This affects methods CharacterBody3D.move_and_slide(),
PhysicsBody3D.move_and_collide(), PhysicsBody3D.test_move() and
PhysicsServer3D.body_test_motion().

Note: This setting will only be read once during the lifetime of the
application.

bool physics/jolt_physics_3d/queries/enable_ray_cast_face_index = `false`

If `true`, populates the `face_index` field in the results of
PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D.intersect_ray(), also accessed through
RayCast3D.get_collision_face_index(). If `false`, the `face_index` field will
be left at its default value of `-1`.

Note: Enabling this setting will increase Jolt's memory usage for
ConcavePolygonShape3D by around 25%.

Note: This setting will only be read once during the lifetime of the
application.

bool physics/jolt_physics_3d/queries/use_enhanced_internal_edge_removal =
`false`

If `true`, enables Jolt's enhanced internal edge removal during shape queries.
This can help alleviate ghost collisions when using shape queries for things
like character movement, but only with edges within a single body, meaning
edges between separate bodies can still cause ghost collisions.

Note: This affects methods PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D.cast_motion(),
PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D.collide_shape(),
PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D.get_rest_info() and
PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D.intersect_shape().

Note: Enabling this setting can cause certain shapes to be culled from the
results entirely, but you will get at least one intersection per body.

Note: This setting will only be read once during the lifetime of the
application.

bool physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/allow_sleep = `true`

If `true`, RigidBody3D nodes are allowed to go to sleep if their velocity is
below the threshold defined in
physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/sleep_velocity_threshold for the duration
set in physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/sleep_time_threshold. This can
improve physics simulation performance when there are non-moving RigidBody3D
nodes, at the cost of some nodes possibly failing to wake up in certain
scenarios. Consider disabling this temporarily to troubleshoot RigidBody3D
nodes not moving when they should.

bool physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/areas_detect_static_bodies = `false`

If `true`, Area3D nodes are able to detect overlaps with StaticBody3D nodes.

Note: Enabling this setting can come at a heavy CPU and memory cost if you
allow many/large Area3D to overlap with complex static geometry, such as
ConcavePolygonShape3D or HeightMapShape3D. It is strongly recommended that you
set up your collision layers and masks in such a way that only a few small
Area3D nodes can detect StaticBody3D nodes.

Note: This also applies to overlaps with a RigidBody3D frozen with
RigidBody3D.FREEZE_MODE_STATIC.

Note: This is not needed to detect overlaps with AnimatableBody3D, as it is a
kinematic body, despite inheriting from StaticBody3D.

float physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/baumgarte_stabilization_factor =
`0.2`

How much of the position error of a RigidBody3D to fix during a physics step,
where `0.0` is none and `1.0` is the full amount. This affects things like how
quickly bodies depenetrate.

Note: Setting this value too high can make RigidBody3D nodes unstable.

physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/body_pair_contact_cache_angle_threshold =
`0.0349066`

The maximum relative angle by which a body pair can move and still reuse the
collision results from the previous physics step, in radians.

float
physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/body_pair_contact_cache_distance_threshold
= `0.001`

The maximum relative distance by which a body pair can move and still reuse
the collision results from the previous physics step, in meters.

bool physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/body_pair_contact_cache_enabled =
`true`

If `true`, enables the body pair contact cache, which removes the need for
potentially expensive collision detection when the relative orientation
between two bodies hasn't changed much.

float physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/bounce_velocity_threshold = `1.0`

The minimum velocity needed before a collision can be bouncy, in meters per
second.

Note: This setting will only be read once during the lifetime of the
application.

float physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/continuous_cd_max_penetration =
`0.25`

Fraction of a body's inner radius that may penetrate another body while using
continuous collision detection.

float physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/continuous_cd_movement_threshold =
`0.75`

Fraction of a body's inner radius that the body must move per step to make use
of continuous collision detection.

bool physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/generate_all_kinematic_contacts =
`false`

If `true`, a RigidBody3D frozen with RigidBody3D.FREEZE_MODE_KINEMATIC is able
to collide with other kinematic and static bodies, and therefore generate
contacts for them.

Note: This setting can come at a heavy CPU and memory cost if you allow
many/large frozen kinematic bodies with a non-zero
RigidBody3D.max_contacts_reported to overlap with complex static geometry,
such as ConcavePolygonShape3D or HeightMapShape3D.

float physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/penetration_slop = `0.02`

How much bodies are allowed to penetrate each other, in meters.

int physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/position_steps = `2`

Number of solver position iterations. The greater the number of iterations,
the more accurate the simulation will be, at the cost of CPU performance.

float physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/sleep_time_threshold = `0.5`

Time in seconds a RigidBody3D will spend below the sleep velocity threshold
before going to sleep.

float physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/sleep_velocity_threshold = `0.03`

The linear velocity of specific points on the bounding box of a RigidBody3D,
below which it can be put to sleep, in meters per second. These points help
capture both the linear and angular motion of a RigidBody3D.

float physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/soft_body_point_radius = `0.01`

How big the points of a SoftBody3D are, in meters. A higher value can prevent
behavior such as cloth laying perfectly flush against other surfaces and
causing Z-fighting.

float physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/speculative_contact_distance = `0.02`

Radius around physics bodies, inside which speculative contact points will be
detected, in meters. This is mainly used to prevent tunneling/penetration for
RigidBody3D nodes during simulation.

Note: Setting this too high may result in ghost collisions, as speculative
contacts are based on the closest points during the collision detection step
which may not be the actual closest points by the time the two bodies hit.

bool physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/use_enhanced_internal_edge_removal =
`true`

If `true`, enables Jolt's enhanced internal edge removal for RigidBody3D. This
can help alleviate ghost collisions when, for example, a RigidBody3D collides
with the edges of two perfectly joined BoxShape3D. The removal only applies to
edges internal to a single body, meaning edges between separate bodies can
still cause ghost collisions.

int physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/velocity_steps = `10`

Number of solver velocity iterations. The greater the number of iterations,
the more accurate the simulation will be, at the cost of CPU performance.

Note: This needs to be at least `2` in order for friction to work, as friction
is applied using the non-penetration impulse from the previous iteration.

int rendering/2d/batching/item_buffer_size = `16384`

Maximum number of canvas item commands that can be batched into a single draw
call.

int rendering/2d/batching/uniform_set_cache_size = `4096`

Maximum number of uniform sets that will be cached by the 2D renderer when
batching draw calls.

Note: A project that uses a large number of unique sprite textures per frame
may benefit from increasing this value.

int rendering/2d/sdf/oversize = `1`

Controls how much of the original viewport size should be covered by the 2D
signed distance field. This SDF can be sampled in CanvasItem shaders and is
used for GPUParticles2D collision. Higher values allow portions of occluders
located outside the viewport to still be taken into account in the generated
signed distance field, at the cost of performance. If you notice particles
falling through LightOccluder2Ds as the occluders leave the viewport, increase
this setting.

The percentage specified is added on each axis and on both sides. For example,
with the default setting of 120%, the signed distance field will cover 20% of
the viewport's size outside the viewport on each side (top, right, bottom,
left).

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To change the 2D SDF
oversizing percentage at runtime, use
RenderingServer.viewport_set_sdf_oversize_and_scale() instead.

int rendering/2d/sdf/scale = `1`

The resolution scale to use for the 2D signed distance field. Higher values
lead to a more precise and more stable signed distance field as the camera
moves, at the cost of performance. The default value (50%) renders at half the
resolution of the viewport size on each axis, which means the SDF is generated
with 25% of the viewport's pixel count.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To change the 2D SDF
resolution scale at runtime, use
RenderingServer.viewport_set_sdf_oversize_and_scale() instead.

int rendering/2d/shadow_atlas/size = `2048`

The size of the 2D shadow atlas in pixels. Higher values result in more
precise Light2D shadows, at the cost of performance and video memory usage.
The specified value is rounded up to the nearest power of 2.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To change the 2D
shadow atlas size at runtime, use
RenderingServer.canvas_set_shadow_texture_size() instead.

bool rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel = `false`

If `true`, CanvasItem nodes will internally snap to full pixels. Useful for
low-resolution pixel art games. Their position can still be sub-pixel, but the
decimals will not have effect as the position is rounded. This can lead to a
crisper appearance at the cost of less smooth movement, especially when
Camera2D smoothing is enabled.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To toggle 2D
transform snapping at runtime, use
RenderingServer.viewport_set_snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel() on the root
Viewport instead.

Note: Control nodes are snapped to the nearest pixel by default. This is
controlled by gui/common/snap_controls_to_pixels.

Note: It is not recommended to use this setting together with
rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_vertices_to_pixel, as movement may appear even less
smooth. Prefer only enabling this setting instead.

bool rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_vertices_to_pixel = `false`

If `true`, vertices of CanvasItem nodes will snap to full pixels. Useful for
low-resolution pixel art games. Only affects the final vertex positions, not
the transforms. This can lead to a crisper appearance at the cost of less
smooth movement, especially when Camera2D smoothing is enabled.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To toggle 2D vertex
snapping at runtime, use
RenderingServer.viewport_set_snap_2d_vertices_to_pixel() on the root Viewport
instead.

Note: Control nodes are snapped to the nearest pixel by default. This is
controlled by gui/common/snap_controls_to_pixels.

Note: It is not recommended to use this setting together with
rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel, as movement may appear even
less smooth. Prefer only enabling that setting instead.

int rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/msaa_2d = `0`

Sets the number of multisample antialiasing (MSAA) samples to use for
2D/Canvas rendering (as a power of two). MSAA is used to reduce aliasing
around the edges of polygons. A higher MSAA value results in smoother edges
but can be significantly slower on some hardware, especially integrated
graphics due to their limited memory bandwidth. This has no effect on shader-
induced aliasing or texture aliasing.

Note: MSAA is only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile rendering methods, not
Compatibility.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To set the number of
2D MSAA samples at runtime, set Viewport.msaa_2d or use
RenderingServer.viewport_set_msaa_2d().

int rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/msaa_3d = `0`

Sets the number of multisample antialiasing (MSAA) samples to use for 3D
rendering (as a power of two). MSAA is used to reduce aliasing around the
edges of polygons. A higher MSAA value results in smoother edges but can be
significantly slower on some hardware, especially integrated graphics due to
their limited memory bandwidth. See also rendering/scaling_3d/mode for
supersampling, which provides higher quality but is much more expensive. This
has no effect on shader-induced aliasing or texture aliasing.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To set the number of
3D MSAA samples at runtime, set Viewport.msaa_3d or use
RenderingServer.viewport_set_msaa_3d().

int rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/screen_space_aa = `0`

Sets the screen-space antialiasing mode for the default screen Viewport.
Screen-space antialiasing works by selectively blurring edges in a post-
process shader. It differs from MSAA which takes multiple coverage samples
while rendering objects. Screen-space AA methods are typically faster than
MSAA and will smooth out specular aliasing, but tend to make scenes appear
blurry. The blurriness is partially counteracted by automatically using a
negative mipmap LOD bias (see
rendering/textures/default_filters/texture_mipmap_bias).

Another way to combat specular aliasing is to enable
rendering/anti_aliasing/screen_space_roughness_limiter/enabled.

Note: Screen-space antialiasing is only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile
rendering methods, not Compatibility.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To set the screen-
space antialiasing mode at runtime, set Viewport.screen_space_aa on the root
Viewport instead, or use RenderingServer.viewport_set_screen_space_aa().

bool rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/use_debanding = `false`

If `true`, uses a fast post-processing filter to make banding significantly
less visible in 3D. 2D rendering is not affected by debanding unless the
Environment.background_mode is Environment.BG_CANVAS.

In some cases, debanding may introduce a slightly noticeable dithering
pattern. It's recommended to enable debanding only when actually needed since
the dithering pattern will make lossless-compressed screenshots larger.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To set debanding at
runtime, set Viewport.use_debanding on the root Viewport instead, or use
RenderingServer.viewport_set_use_debanding().

bool rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/use_taa = `false`

Enables temporal antialiasing for the default screen Viewport. TAA works by
jittering the camera and accumulating the images of the last rendered frames,
motion vector rendering is used to account for camera and object motion.
Enabling TAA can make the image blurrier, which is partially counteracted by
automatically using a negative mipmap LOD bias (see
rendering/textures/default_filters/texture_mipmap_bias).

Note: The implementation is not complete yet. Some visual instances such as
particles and skinned meshes may show ghosting artifacts in motion.

Note: TAA is only supported in the Forward+ rendering method, not Mobile or
Compatibility.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To set TAA at
runtime, set Viewport.use_taa on the root Viewport instead, or use
RenderingServer.viewport_set_use_taa().

float rendering/anti_aliasing/screen_space_roughness_limiter/amount = `0.25`

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To control the
screen-space roughness limiter at runtime, call
RenderingServer.screen_space_roughness_limiter_set_active() instead.

bool rendering/anti_aliasing/screen_space_roughness_limiter/enabled = `true`

If `true`, enables a spatial filter to limit roughness in areas with high-
frequency detail. This can help reduce specular aliasing to an extent, though
not as much as enabling rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/use_taa. This filter
has a small performance cost, so consider disabling it if it doesn't benefit
your scene noticeably.

Note: The screen-space roughness limiter is only supported in the Forward+ and
Mobile rendering methods, not Compatibility.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To control the
screen-space roughness limiter at runtime, call
RenderingServer.screen_space_roughness_limiter_set_active() instead.

float rendering/anti_aliasing/screen_space_roughness_limiter/limit = `0.18`

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To control the
screen-space roughness limiter at runtime, call
RenderingServer.screen_space_roughness_limiter_set_active() instead.

int rendering/camera/depth_of_field/depth_of_field_bokeh_quality = `1`

Sets the quality of the depth of field effect. Higher quality takes more
samples, which is slower but looks smoother.

int rendering/camera/depth_of_field/depth_of_field_bokeh_shape = `1`

Sets the depth of field shape. Can be Box, Hexagon, or Circle. Box is the
fastest. Circle is the most realistic, but also the most expensive to compute.

bool rendering/camera/depth_of_field/depth_of_field_use_jitter = `false`

If `true`, jitters DOF samples to make effect slightly blurrier and hide lines
created from low sample rates. This can result in a slightly grainy appearance
when used with a low number of samples.

String rendering/driver/depth_prepass/disable_for_vendors =
`"PowerVR,Mali,Adreno,Apple"`

Disables rendering/driver/depth_prepass/enable conditionally for certain
vendors. By default, disables the depth prepass for mobile devices as mobile
devices do not benefit from the depth prepass due to their unique
architecture.

bool rendering/driver/depth_prepass/enable = `true`

If `true`, performs a previous depth pass before rendering 3D materials. This
increases performance significantly in scenes with high overdraw, when complex
materials and lighting are used. However, in scenes with few occluded
surfaces, the depth prepass may reduce performance. If your game is viewed
from a fixed angle that makes it easy to avoid overdraw (such as top-down or
side-scrolling perspective), consider disabling the depth prepass to improve
performance. This setting can be changed at run-time to optimize performance
depending on the scene currently being viewed.

Note: Depth prepass is only supported when using the Forward+ or Compatibility
rendering method. When using the Mobile rendering method, there is no depth
prepass performed.

int rendering/driver/threads/thread_model = `1`

Experimental: This setting has several known bugs which can lead to crashing,
especially when using particles or resizing the window. Not recommended for
use in production at this stage.

The thread model to use for rendering. Rendering on a thread may improve
performance, but synchronizing to the main thread can cause a bit more jitter.

Color rendering/environment/defaults/default_clear_color = `Color(0.3, 0.3,
0.3, 1)`

Default background clear color. Overridable per Viewport using its
Environment. See Environment.background_mode and Environment.background_color
in particular. To change this default color programmatically, use
RenderingServer.set_default_clear_color().

String rendering/environment/defaults/default_environment = `""`

Environment that will be used as a fallback environment in case a scene does
not specify its own environment. The default environment is loaded in at scene
load time regardless of whether you have set an environment or not. If you do
not rely on the fallback environment, you do not need to set this property.

int rendering/environment/glow/upscale_mode = `1`

Sets how the glow effect is upscaled before being copied onto the screen.
Linear is faster, but looks blocky. Bicubic is slower but looks smooth.

int rendering/environment/glow/upscale_mode.mobile = `0`

Lower-end override for rendering/environment/glow/upscale_mode on mobile
devices, due to performance concerns or driver support.

int rendering/environment/screen_space_reflection/roughness_quality = `1`

Sets the quality for rough screen-space reflections. Turning off will make all
screen space reflections sharp, while higher values make rough reflections
look better.

float rendering/environment/ssao/adaptive_target = `0.5`

Quality target to use when rendering/environment/ssao/quality is set to
`Ultra`. A value of `0.0` provides a quality and speed similar to `Medium`
while a value of `1.0` provides much higher quality than any of the other
settings at the cost of performance.

int rendering/environment/ssao/blur_passes = `2`

Number of blur passes to use when computing screen-space ambient occlusion. A
higher number will result in a smoother look, but will be slower to compute
and will have less high-frequency detail.

float rendering/environment/ssao/fadeout_from = `50.0`

Distance at which the screen-space ambient occlusion effect starts to fade
out. Use this hide ambient occlusion from far away.

float rendering/environment/ssao/fadeout_to = `300.0`

Distance at which the screen-space ambient occlusion is fully faded out. Use
this hide ambient occlusion from far away.

bool rendering/environment/ssao/half_size = `true`

If `true`, screen-space ambient occlusion will be rendered at half size and
then upscaled before being added to the scene. This is significantly faster
but may miss small details. If `false`, screen-space ambient occlusion will be
rendered at full size.

int rendering/environment/ssao/quality = `2`

Sets the quality of the screen-space ambient occlusion effect. Higher values
take more samples and so will result in better quality, at the cost of
performance. Setting to `Ultra` will use the
rendering/environment/ssao/adaptive_target setting.

float rendering/environment/ssil/adaptive_target = `0.5`

Quality target to use when rendering/environment/ssil/quality is set to
`Ultra`. A value of `0.0` provides a quality and speed similar to `Medium`
while a value of `1.0` provides much higher quality than any of the other
settings at the cost of performance. When using the adaptive target, the
performance cost scales with the complexity of the scene.

int rendering/environment/ssil/blur_passes = `4`

Number of blur passes to use when computing screen-space indirect lighting. A
higher number will result in a smoother look, but will be slower to compute
and will have less high-frequency detail.

float rendering/environment/ssil/fadeout_from = `50.0`

Distance at which the screen-space indirect lighting effect starts to fade
out. Use this to hide screen-space indirect lighting from far away.

float rendering/environment/ssil/fadeout_to = `300.0`

Distance at which the screen-space indirect lighting is fully faded out. Use
this to hide screen-space indirect lighting from far away.

bool rendering/environment/ssil/half_size = `true`

If `true`, screen-space indirect lighting will be rendered at half size and
then upscaled before being added to the scene. This is significantly faster
but may miss small details and may result in some objects appearing to glow at
their edges.

int rendering/environment/ssil/quality = `2`

Sets the quality of the screen-space indirect lighting effect. Higher values
take more samples and so will result in better quality, at the cost of
performance. Setting to `Ultra` will use the
rendering/environment/ssil/adaptive_target setting.

float
rendering/environment/subsurface_scattering/subsurface_scattering_depth_scale
= `0.01`

Scales the depth over which the subsurface scattering effect is applied. A
high value may allow light to scatter into a part of the mesh or another mesh
that is close in screen space but far in depth. See also
rendering/environment/subsurface_scattering/subsurface_scattering_scale.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To set the
subsurface scattering depth scale at runtime, call
RenderingServer.sub_surface_scattering_set_scale() instead.

int rendering/environment/subsurface_scattering/subsurface_scattering_quality
= `1`

Sets the quality of the subsurface scattering effect. Higher values are slower
but look nicer. This affects the rendering of materials that have
BaseMaterial3D.subsurf_scatter_enabled set to `true`, along with
ShaderMaterials that set `SSS_STRENGTH`.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To set the
subsurface scattering quality at runtime, call
RenderingServer.sub_surface_scattering_set_quality() instead.

float rendering/environment/subsurface_scattering/subsurface_scattering_scale
= `0.05`

Scales the distance over which samples are taken for subsurface scattering
effect. Changing this does not impact performance, but higher values will
result in significant artifacts as the samples will become obviously spread
out. A lower value results in a smaller spread of scattered light. See also
rendering/environment/subsurface_scattering/subsurface_scattering_depth_scale.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To set the
subsurface scattering scale at runtime, call
RenderingServer.sub_surface_scattering_set_scale() instead.

int rendering/environment/volumetric_fog/use_filter = `1`

Enables filtering of the volumetric fog effect prior to integration. This
substantially blurs the fog which reduces fine details but also smooths out
harsh edges and aliasing artifacts. Disable when more detail is required.

int rendering/environment/volumetric_fog/volume_depth = `64`

Number of slices to use along the depth of the froxel buffer for volumetric
fog. A lower number will be more efficient but may result in artifacts
appearing during camera movement. See also Environment.volumetric_fog_length.

int rendering/environment/volumetric_fog/volume_size = `64`

Base size used to determine size of froxel buffer in the camera X-axis and
Y-axis. The final size is scaled by the aspect ratio of the screen, so actual
values may differ from what is set. Set a larger size for more detailed fog,
set a smaller size for better performance.

String rendering/gl_compatibility/driver = `"opengl3"`

Sets the driver to be used by the renderer when using the Compatibility
renderer. Editing this property has no effect in the default configuration, as
first-party platforms each have platform-specific overrides. Use those
overrides to configure the driver for each platform.

This can be overridden using the `--rendering-driver <driver>` command line
argument.

Supported values are:

  * `opengl3`, OpenGL 3.3 on desktop platforms, OpenGL ES 3.0 on mobile platforms, WebGL 2.0 on web.

  * `opengl3_angle`, OpenGL ES 3.0 using the ANGLE compatibility layer, supported on macOS (over native OpenGL) and Windows (over Direct3D 11).

  * `opengl3_es`, OpenGL ES 3.0 on Linux/BSD.

Note: The availability of these options depends on whether the engine was
compiled with support for them (determined by SCons options `opengl3` and
`angle_libs`).

Note: The actual rendering driver may be automatically changed by the engine
as a result of a fallback, or a user-specified command line argument. To get
the actual rendering driver that is used at runtime, use
RenderingServer.get_current_rendering_driver_name() instead of reading this
project setting's value.

String rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.android = `"opengl3"`

Android override for rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.

Only one option is supported:

  * `opengl3`, OpenGL ES 3.0 from native drivers.

String rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.ios = `"opengl3"`

iOS override for rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.

Only one option is supported:

  * `opengl3`, OpenGL ES 3.0 from native drivers.

String rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.linuxbsd = `"opengl3"`

LinuxBSD override for rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.

Two options are supported:

  * `opengl3` (default), OpenGL 3.3 from native drivers.

  * `opengl3_es`, OpenGL ES 3.0 from native drivers. If rendering/gl_compatibility/fallback_to_gles is enabled, this is used as a fallback if OpenGL 3.3 is not supported.

String rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.macos = `"opengl3"`

macOS override for rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.

Two options are supported:

  * `opengl3` (default), OpenGL 3.3 from native drivers. If rendering/gl_compatibility/fallback_to_native is enabled, this is used as a fallback if ANGLE is configured as the preferred driver but not supported.

  * `opengl3_angle`, OpenGL ES 3.0 using the ANGLE compatibility layer over native OpenGL drivers. If rendering/gl_compatibility/fallback_to_angle is enabled, this is used as a fallback if OpenGL 3.3 is not supported.

String rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.web = `"opengl3"`

Web override for rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.

Only one option is supported:

  * `opengl3`, WebGL 2.0. The underlying native API depends on the target OS, browser, and browser configuration.

String rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.windows = `"opengl3"`

Windows override for rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.

Two options are supported:

  * `opengl3` (default), OpenGL 3.3 from native drivers. If rendering/gl_compatibility/fallback_to_native is enabled, this is used as a fallback if ANGLE is configured as the preferred driver but not supported.

  * `opengl3_angle`, OpenGL ES 3.0 using the ANGLE compatibility layer over native Direct3D 11 drivers. If rendering/gl_compatibility/fallback_to_angle is enabled, this is used as a fallback if OpenGL 3.3 is not supported. By default, ANGLE is used as the default driver for some devices listed in rendering/gl_compatibility/force_angle_on_devices.

bool rendering/gl_compatibility/fallback_to_angle = `true`

If `true`, the compatibility renderer will fall back to ANGLE if native OpenGL
is not supported or the device is listed in
rendering/gl_compatibility/force_angle_on_devices.

Note: This setting is implemented only on Windows.

bool rendering/gl_compatibility/fallback_to_gles = `true`

If `true`, the compatibility renderer will fall back to OpenGLES if desktop
OpenGL is not supported.

Note: This setting is implemented only on Linux/X11.

bool rendering/gl_compatibility/fallback_to_native = `true`

If `true`, the compatibility renderer will fall back to native OpenGL if ANGLE
is not supported, or ANGLE dynamic libraries aren't found.

Note: This setting is implemented on macOS and Windows.

Array rendering/gl_compatibility/force_angle_on_devices

An Array of devices which should always use the ANGLE renderer.

Each entry is a Dictionary with the following keys: `vendor` and `name`.
`name` can be set to `*` to add all devices with the specified `vendor`.

Note: This setting is implemented only on Windows.

int rendering/gl_compatibility/item_buffer_size = `16384`

Maximum number of canvas items commands that can be drawn in a single viewport
update. If more render commands are issued they will be ignored. Decreasing
this limit may improve performance on bandwidth limited devices. Increase this
limit if you find that not all objects are being drawn in a frame.

bool rendering/gl_compatibility/nvidia_disable_threaded_optimization = `true`

If `true`, disables the threaded optimization feature from the NVIDIA drivers,
which are known to cause stuttering in most OpenGL applications.

Note: This setting only works on Windows, as threaded optimization is disabled
by default on other platforms.

bool rendering/global_illumination/gi/use_half_resolution = `false`

If `true`, renders VoxelGI and SDFGI (Environment.sdfgi_enabled) buffers at
halved resolution (e.g. 960540 when the viewport size is 19201080). This
improves performance significantly when VoxelGI or SDFGI is enabled, at the
cost of artifacts that may be visible on polygon edges. The loss in quality
becomes less noticeable as the viewport resolution increases. LightmapGI
rendering is not affected by this setting.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To set half-
resolution GI at run-time, call RenderingServer.gi_set_use_half_resolution()
instead.

int rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/frames_to_converge = `5`

The number of frames to use for converging signed distance field global
illumination. Higher values lead to a less noisy result, at the cost of taking
a longer time to fully converge. This means the scene's global illumination
will be too dark for a longer period of time, especially when the camera moves
fast. The actual convergence speed depends on rendered framerate. For example,
with the default setting of 30 frames, rendering at 60 FPS will make SDFGI
fully converge after 0.5 seconds. See also
rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/frames_to_update_lights and
rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/probe_ray_count.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To control SDFGI
convergence speed at runtime, call
RenderingServer.environment_set_sdfgi_frames_to_converge() instead.

int rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/frames_to_update_lights = `2`

The number of frames over which dynamic lights should be updated in signed
distance field global illumination. Higher values take more time to update
indirect lighting coming from dynamic lights, but result in better performance
when many dynamic lights are present. See also
rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/frames_to_converge and
rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/probe_ray_count.

Note: This only affects Light3D nodes whose Light3D.light_bake_mode is
Light3D.BAKE_DYNAMIC (which is the default). Consider making non-moving lights
use the Light3D.BAKE_STATIC bake mode to improve performance.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To control SDFGI
light update speed at runtime, call
RenderingServer.environment_set_sdfgi_frames_to_update_light() instead.

int rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/probe_ray_count = `1`

The number of rays to throw per frame when computing signed distance field
global illumination. Higher values lead to a less noisy result, at the cost of
performance. See also rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/frames_to_converge
and rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/frames_to_update_lights.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To control SDFGI
quality at runtime, call RenderingServer.environment_set_sdfgi_ray_count()
instead.

int rendering/global_illumination/voxel_gi/quality = `0`

The VoxelGI quality to use. High quality leads to more precise lighting and
better reflections, but is slower to render. This setting does not affect the
baked data and doesn't require baking the VoxelGI again to apply.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To control VoxelGI
quality at runtime, call RenderingServer.voxel_gi_set_quality() instead.

int rendering/lightmapping/bake_performance/max_rays_per_pass = `4`

The maximum number of rays that can be thrown per pass when baking lightmaps
with LightmapGI. Depending on the scene, adjusting this value may result in
higher GPU utilization when baking lightmaps, leading to faster bake times.

Note: Using a value that is too high for your system can cause crashes due to
the GPU being unresponsive for long periods of time, and the graphics driver
being reset by the OS.

int rendering/lightmapping/bake_performance/max_rays_per_probe_pass = `64`

The maximum number of rays that can be thrown per pass when baking dynamic
object lighting in LightmapProbes with LightmapGI. Depending on the scene,
adjusting this value may result in higher GPU utilization when baking
lightmaps, leading to faster bake times.

Note: Using a value that is too high for your system can cause crashes due to
the GPU being unresponsive for long periods of time, and the graphics driver
being reset by the OS.

int rendering/lightmapping/bake_performance/max_transparency_rays = `8`

The maximum number of retry rays that can be thrown per pass when hitting a
transparent surface when baking lightmaps with LightmapGI. Depending on the
scene, reducing this value may lead to faster bake times.

Note: Using a value that is too high for your system can cause crashes due to
the GPU being unresponsive for long periods of time, and the graphics driver
being reset by the OS.

int rendering/lightmapping/bake_performance/region_size = `512`

The region size to use when baking lightmaps with LightmapGI. The specified
value is rounded up to the nearest power of 2.

Note: Using a value that is too high for your system can cause crashes due to
the GPU being unresponsive for long periods of time, and the graphics driver
being reset by the OS.

int rendering/lightmapping/bake_quality/high_quality_probe_ray_count = `512`

The number of rays to use for baking dynamic object lighting in LightmapProbes
when LightmapGI.quality is LightmapGI.BAKE_QUALITY_HIGH.

int rendering/lightmapping/bake_quality/high_quality_ray_count = `512`

The number of rays to use for baking lightmaps with LightmapGI when
LightmapGI.quality is LightmapGI.BAKE_QUALITY_HIGH.

int rendering/lightmapping/bake_quality/low_quality_probe_ray_count = `64`

The number of rays to use for baking dynamic object lighting in LightmapProbes
when LightmapGI.quality is LightmapGI.BAKE_QUALITY_LOW.

int rendering/lightmapping/bake_quality/low_quality_ray_count = `32`

The number of rays to use for baking lightmaps with LightmapGI when
LightmapGI.quality is LightmapGI.BAKE_QUALITY_LOW.

int rendering/lightmapping/bake_quality/medium_quality_probe_ray_count = `256`

The number of rays to use for baking dynamic object lighting in LightmapProbes
when LightmapGI.quality is LightmapGI.BAKE_QUALITY_MEDIUM.

int rendering/lightmapping/bake_quality/medium_quality_ray_count = `128`

The number of rays to use for baking lightmaps with LightmapGI when
LightmapGI.quality is LightmapGI.BAKE_QUALITY_MEDIUM.

int rendering/lightmapping/bake_quality/ultra_quality_probe_ray_count = `2048`

The number of rays to use for baking dynamic object lighting in LightmapProbes
when LightmapGI.quality is LightmapGI.BAKE_QUALITY_ULTRA.

int rendering/lightmapping/bake_quality/ultra_quality_ray_count = `2048`

The number of rays to use for baking lightmaps with LightmapGI when
LightmapGI.quality is LightmapGI.BAKE_QUALITY_ULTRA.

int rendering/lightmapping/denoising/denoiser = `0`

Denoiser tool used for denoising lightmaps.

Using OpenImageDenoise (OIDN) requires configuring a path to an OIDN
executable in the editor settings at
EditorSettings.filesystem/tools/oidn/oidn_denoise_path. OIDN can be downloaded
from OpenImageDenoise's downloads page.

OIDN will use GPU acceleration when available. Unlike JNLM which uses compute
shaders for acceleration, OIDN uses vendor-specific acceleration methods. For
GPU acceleration to be available, the following libraries must be installed on
the system depending on your GPU:

  * NVIDIA GPUs: CUDA libraries

  * AMD GPUs: HIP libraries

  * Intel GPUs: SYCL libraries

If no GPU acceleration is configured on the system, multi-threaded CPU-based
denoising will be performed instead. This CPU-based denoising is significantly
slower than the JNLM denoiser in most cases.

bool rendering/lightmapping/lightmap_gi/use_bicubic_filter = `true`

If `true`, applies a bicubic filter during lightmap sampling. This makes
lightmaps look much smoother, at a moderate performance cost.

Note: The bicubic filter exaggerates the 'bleeding' effect that occurs when a
lightmap's resolution is low enough.

float rendering/lightmapping/primitive_meshes/texel_size = `0.2`

The texel_size that is used to calculate the Mesh.lightmap_size_hint on
PrimitiveMesh resources if PrimitiveMesh.add_uv2 is enabled.

float rendering/lightmapping/probe_capture/update_speed = `15`

The framerate-independent update speed when representing dynamic object
lighting from LightmapProbes. Higher values make dynamic object lighting
update faster. Higher values can prevent fast-moving objects from having
"outdated" indirect lighting displayed on them, at the cost of possible
flickering when an object moves from a bright area to a shaded area.

bool rendering/lights_and_shadows/directional_shadow/16_bits = `true`

Use 16 bits for the directional shadow depth map. Enabling this results in
shadows having less precision and may result in shadow acne, but can lead to
performance improvements on some devices.

int rendering/lights_and_shadows/directional_shadow/size = `4096`

The directional shadow's size in pixels. Higher values will result in sharper
shadows, at the cost of performance. The value is rounded up to the nearest
power of 2.

int rendering/lights_and_shadows/directional_shadow/size.mobile = `2048`

Lower-end override for rendering/lights_and_shadows/directional_shadow/size on
mobile devices, due to performance concerns or driver support.

int rendering/lights_and_shadows/directional_shadow/soft_shadow_filter_quality
= `2`

Quality setting for shadows cast by DirectionalLight3Ds. Higher quality
settings use more samples when reading from shadow maps and are thus slower.
Low quality settings may result in shadows looking grainy.

Note: The Soft Very Low setting will automatically multiply constant shadow
blur by 0.75x to reduce the amount of noise visible. This automatic blur
change only affects the constant blur factor defined in Light3D.shadow_blur,
not the variable blur performed by DirectionalLight3Ds'
Light3D.light_angular_distance.

Note: The Soft High and Soft Ultra settings will automatically multiply
constant shadow blur by 1.5 and 2 respectively to make better use of the
increased sample count. This increased blur also improves stability of dynamic
object shadows.

int
rendering/lights_and_shadows/directional_shadow/soft_shadow_filter_quality.mobile
= `0`

Lower-end override for
rendering/lights_and_shadows/directional_shadow/soft_shadow_filter_quality on
mobile devices, due to performance concerns or driver support.

bool rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/atlas_16_bits = `true`

Use 16 bits for the omni/spot shadow depth map. Enabling this results in
shadows having less precision and may result in shadow acne, but can lead to
performance improvements on some devices.

int rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/atlas_quadrant_0_subdiv =
`2`

Subdivision quadrant size for shadow mapping. See shadow mapping
documentation.

int rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/atlas_quadrant_1_subdiv =
`2`

Subdivision quadrant size for shadow mapping. See shadow mapping
documentation.

int rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/atlas_quadrant_2_subdiv =
`3`

Subdivision quadrant size for shadow mapping. See shadow mapping
documentation.

int rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/atlas_quadrant_3_subdiv =
`4`

Subdivision quadrant size for shadow mapping. See shadow mapping
documentation.

int rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/atlas_size = `4096`

Size for shadow atlas (used for OmniLights and SpotLights). See documentation.

int rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/atlas_size.mobile = `2048`

Lower-end override for
rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/atlas_size on mobile devices,
due to performance concerns or driver support.

int rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/soft_shadow_filter_quality
= `2`

Quality setting for shadows cast by OmniLight3Ds and SpotLight3Ds. Higher
quality settings use more samples when reading from shadow maps and are thus
slower. Low quality settings may result in shadows looking grainy.

Note: The Soft Very Low setting will automatically multiply constant shadow
blur by 0.75x to reduce the amount of noise visible. This automatic blur
change only affects the constant blur factor defined in Light3D.shadow_blur,
not the variable blur performed by DirectionalLight3Ds'
Light3D.light_angular_distance.

Note: The Soft High and Soft Ultra settings will automatically multiply shadow
blur by 1.5 and 2 respectively to make better use of the increased sample
count. This increased blur also improves stability of dynamic object shadows.

int
rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/soft_shadow_filter_quality.mobile
= `0`

Lower-end override for
rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/soft_shadow_filter_quality on
mobile devices, due to performance concerns or driver support.

bool rendering/lights_and_shadows/tighter_shadow_caster_culling = `true`

If `true`, items that cannot cast shadows into the view frustum will not be
rendered into shadow maps.

This can increase performance.

bool rendering/lights_and_shadows/use_physical_light_units = `false`

Enables the use of physically based units for light sources. Physically based
units tend to be much larger than the arbitrary units used by Godot, but they
can be used to match lighting within Godot to real-world lighting. Due to the
large dynamic range of lighting conditions present in nature, Godot bakes
exposure into the various lighting quantities before rendering. Most light
sources bake exposure automatically at run time based on the active
CameraAttributes resource, but LightmapGI and VoxelGI require a
CameraAttributes resource to be set at bake time to reduce the dynamic range.
At run time, Godot will automatically reconcile the baked exposure with the
active exposure to ensure lighting remains consistent.

float rendering/limits/cluster_builder/max_clustered_elements = `512`

The maximum number of clustered elements (OmniLight3D \+ SpotLight3D \+ Decal
\+ ReflectionProbe) that can be rendered at once in the camera view. If there
are more clustered elements present in the camera view, some of them will not
be rendered (leading to pop-in during camera movement). Enabling distance fade
on lights and decals (Light3D.distance_fade_enabled,
Decal.distance_fade_enabled) can help avoid reaching this limit.

Decreasing this value may improve GPU performance on certain setups, even if
the maximum number of clustered elements is never reached in the project.

Note: This setting is only effective when using the Forward+ rendering method,
not Mobile and Compatibility.

int rendering/limits/global_shader_variables/buffer_size = `65536`

The maximum number of uniforms that can be used by the global shader uniform
buffer. Each item takes up one slot. In other words, a single uniform float
and a uniform vec4 will take the same amount of space in the buffer.

Note: When using the Compatibility renderer, most mobile devices (and all web
exports) will be limited to a maximum size of 1024 due to hardware
constraints.

int rendering/limits/opengl/max_lights_per_object = `8`

Max number of omnilights and spotlights renderable per object. At the default
value of 8, this means that each surface can be affected by up to 8 omnilights
and 8 spotlights. This is further limited by hardware support and
rendering/limits/opengl/max_renderable_lights. Setting this low will slightly
reduce memory usage, may decrease shader compile times, and may result in
faster rendering on low-end, mobile, or web devices.

Note: This setting is only effective when using the Compatibility rendering
method, not Forward+ and Mobile.

int rendering/limits/opengl/max_renderable_elements = `65536`

Max number of elements renderable in a frame. If more elements than this are
visible per frame, they will not be drawn. Keep in mind elements refer to mesh
surfaces and not meshes themselves. Setting this low will slightly reduce
memory usage and may decrease shader compile times, particularly on web. For
most uses, the default value is suitable, but consider lowering as much as
possible on web export.

Note: This setting is only effective when using the Compatibility rendering
method, not Forward+ and Mobile.

int rendering/limits/opengl/max_renderable_lights = `32`

Max number of positional lights renderable in a frame. If more lights than
this number are used, they will be ignored. Setting this low will slightly
reduce memory usage and may decrease shader compile times, particularly on
web. For most uses, the default value is suitable, but consider lowering as
much as possible on web export.

Note: This setting is only effective when using the Compatibility rendering
method, not Forward+ and Mobile.

int rendering/limits/spatial_indexer/threaded_cull_minimum_instances = `1000`

The minimum number of instances that must be present in a scene to enable
culling computations on multiple threads. If a scene has fewer instances than
this number, culling is done on a single thread.

int rendering/limits/spatial_indexer/update_iterations_per_frame = `10`

There is currently no description for this property. Please help us by
contributing one!

float rendering/limits/time/time_rollover_secs = `3600`

Maximum time (in seconds) before the `TIME` shader built-in variable rolls
over. The `TIME` variable increments by `delta` each frame, and when it
exceeds this value, it rolls over to `0.0`. Since large floating-point values
are less precise than small floating-point values, this should be set as low
as possible to maximize the precision of the `TIME` built-in variable in
shaders. This is especially important on mobile platforms where precision in
shaders is significantly reduced. However, if this is set too low, shader
animations may appear to restart from the beginning while the project is
running.

On desktop platforms, values below `4096` are recommended, ideally below
`2048`. On mobile platforms, values below `64` are recommended, ideally below
`32`.

float rendering/mesh_lod/lod_change/threshold_pixels = `1.0`

The automatic LOD bias to use for meshes rendered within the ReflectionProbe.
Higher values will use less detailed versions of meshes that have LOD
variations generated. If set to `0.0`, automatic LOD is disabled. Increase
rendering/mesh_lod/lod_change/threshold_pixels to improve performance at the
cost of geometry detail.

Note: rendering/mesh_lod/lod_change/threshold_pixels does not affect
GeometryInstance3D visibility ranges (also known as "manual" LOD or
hierarchical LOD).

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To adjust the
automatic LOD threshold at runtime, set Viewport.mesh_lod_threshold on the
root Viewport.

int rendering/occlusion_culling/bvh_build_quality = `2`

The Bounding Volume Hierarchy quality to use when rendering the occlusion
culling buffer. Higher values will result in more accurate occlusion culling,
at the cost of higher CPU usage. See also
rendering/occlusion_culling/occlusion_rays_per_thread.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To adjust the BVH
build quality at runtime, use
RenderingServer.viewport_set_occlusion_culling_build_quality().

bool rendering/occlusion_culling/jitter_projection = `true`

If `true`, the projection used for rendering the occlusion buffer will be
jittered. This can help prevent objects being incorrectly culled when visible
through small gaps.

int rendering/occlusion_culling/occlusion_rays_per_thread = `512`

The number of occlusion rays traced per CPU thread. Higher values will result
in more accurate occlusion culling, at the cost of higher CPU usage. The
occlusion culling buffer's pixel count is roughly equal to
`occlusion_rays_per_thread * number_of_logical_cpu_cores`, so it will depend
on the system's CPU. Therefore, CPUs with fewer cores will use a lower
resolution to attempt keeping performance costs even across devices. See also
rendering/occlusion_culling/bvh_build_quality.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To adjust the number
of occlusion rays traced per thread at runtime, use
RenderingServer.viewport_set_occlusion_rays_per_thread().

bool rendering/occlusion_culling/use_occlusion_culling = `false`

If `true`, OccluderInstance3D nodes will be usable for occlusion culling in 3D
in the root viewport. In custom viewports, Viewport.use_occlusion_culling must
be set to `true` instead.

Note: Enabling occlusion culling has a cost on the CPU. Only enable occlusion
culling if you actually plan to use it. Large open scenes with few or no
objects blocking the view will generally not benefit much from occlusion
culling. Large open scenes generally benefit more from mesh LOD and visibility
ranges (GeometryInstance3D.visibility_range_begin and
GeometryInstance3D.visibility_range_end) compared to occlusion culling.

Note: Due to memory constraints, occlusion culling is not supported by default
in Web export templates. It can be enabled by compiling custom Web export
templates with `module_raycast_enabled=yes`.

int rendering/reflections/reflection_atlas/reflection_count = `64`

Number of cubemaps to store in the reflection atlas. The number of
ReflectionProbes in a scene will be limited by this amount. A higher number
requires more VRAM.

int rendering/reflections/reflection_atlas/reflection_size = `256`

Size of cubemap faces for ReflectionProbes. A higher number requires more VRAM
and may make reflection probe updating slower.

int rendering/reflections/reflection_atlas/reflection_size.mobile = `128`

Lower-end override for rendering/reflections/reflection_atlas/reflection_size
on mobile devices, due to performance concerns or driver support.

bool rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/fast_filter_high_quality = `false`

Use a higher quality variant of the fast filtering algorithm. Significantly
slower than using default quality, but results in smoother reflections. Should
only be used when the scene is especially detailed.

int rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/ggx_samples = `32`

Sets the number of samples to take when using importance sampling for Skys and
ReflectionProbes. A higher value will result in smoother, higher quality
reflections, but increases time to calculate radiance maps. In general, fewer
samples are needed for simpler, low dynamic range environments while more
samples are needed for HDR environments and environments with a high level of
detail.

int rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/ggx_samples.mobile = `16`

Lower-end override for rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/ggx_samples on
mobile devices, due to performance concerns or driver support.

int rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/roughness_layers = `8`

Limits the number of layers to use in radiance maps when using importance
sampling. A lower number will be slightly faster and take up less VRAM.

bool rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/texture_array_reflections = `true`

If `true`, uses texture arrays instead of mipmaps for reflection probes and
panorama backgrounds (sky). This reduces jitter noise and upscaling artifacts
on reflections, but is significantly slower to compute and uses
rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/roughness_layers times more memory.

bool rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/texture_array_reflections.mobile =
`false`

Lower-end override for
rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/texture_array_reflections on mobile
devices, due to performance concerns or driver support.

String rendering/renderer/rendering_method = `"forward_plus"`

Sets the renderer that will be used by the project. Options are:

forward_plus (Forward+): High-end renderer designed for desktop devices. Has a
higher base overhead, but scales well with complex scenes. Not suitable for
older devices or mobile.

mobile (Mobile): Modern renderer designed for mobile devices. Has a lower base
overhead than Forward+, but does not scale as well to large scenes with many
elements.

gl_compatibility (Compatibility): Low-end renderer designed for older devices.
Based on the limitations of the OpenGL 3.3 / OpenGL ES 3.0 / WebGL 2 APIs.

This can be overridden using the `--rendering-method <method>` command line
argument.

Note: The actual rendering method may be automatically changed by the engine
as a result of a fallback, or a user-specified command line argument. To get
the actual rendering method that is used at runtime, use
RenderingServer.get_current_rendering_method() instead of reading this project
setting's value.

String rendering/renderer/rendering_method.mobile = `"mobile"`

Override for rendering/renderer/rendering_method on mobile devices.

String rendering/renderer/rendering_method.web = `"gl_compatibility"`

Override for rendering/renderer/rendering_method on web.

int rendering/rendering_device/d3d12/agility_sdk_version = `613`

Version code of the Direct3D 12 Agility SDK to use (`D3D12SDKVersion`). This
must match the minor version that is installed next to the editor binary and
in the export templates directory for the current editor version. For example,
if you have `1.613.3` installed, you need to input `613` here.

int rendering/rendering_device/d3d12/max_misc_descriptors_per_frame = `512`

The number of entries in the miscellaneous descriptors heap the Direct3D 12
rendering driver uses each frame, used for various operations like clearing a
texture.

Depending on the complexity of scenes, this value may be lowered or may need
to be raised.

int rendering/rendering_device/d3d12/max_resource_descriptors_per_frame =
`16384`

The number of entries in the resource descriptors heap the Direct3D 12
rendering driver uses each frame, used for most rendering operations.

Depending on the complexity of scenes, this value may be lowered or may need
to be raised.

int rendering/rendering_device/d3d12/max_sampler_descriptors_per_frame =
`1024`

The number of entries in the sampler descriptors heap the Direct3D 12
rendering driver uses each frame, used for most rendering operations.

Depending on the complexity of scenes, this value may be lowered or may need
to be raised.

String rendering/rendering_device/driver = `"vulkan"`

Sets the driver to be used by the renderer when using a RenderingDevice-based
renderer like the Forward+ or Mobile renderers. Editing this property has no
effect in the default configuration, as first-party platforms each have
platform-specific overrides. Use those overrides to configure the driver for
each platform.

This can be overridden using the `--rendering-driver <driver>` command line
argument.

Supported values are:

  * `metal`, Metal (supported on Apple Silicon Macs and iOS).

  * `vulkan`, Vulkan (supported on all desktop and mobile platforms).

  * `d3d12`, Direct3D 12 (supported on Windows).

Note: The availability of these options depends on whether the engine was
compiled with support for them (determined by SCons options `vulkan`, `metal`,
and `d3d12`).

Note: If a given platform has no registered drivers, it can fall back to the
Compatibility renderer (OpenGL 3) if
rendering/rendering_device/fallback_to_opengl3 is enabled. This fallback
happens automatically for the Web platform regardless of that property.

Note: The actual rendering driver may be automatically changed by the engine
as a result of a fallback, or a user-specified command line argument. To get
the actual rendering driver that is used at runtime, use
RenderingServer.get_current_rendering_driver_name() instead of reading this
project setting's value.

String rendering/rendering_device/driver.android = `"vulkan"`

Android override for rendering/rendering_device/driver.

Only one option is supported:

  * `vulkan`, Vulkan from native drivers.

Note: If Vulkan was disabled at compile time, there is no alternative
RenderingDevice driver.

String rendering/rendering_device/driver.ios = `"metal"`

iOS override for rendering/rendering_device/driver.

Two options are supported:

  * `metal` (default), Metal from native drivers.

  * `vulkan`, Vulkan over Metal via MoltenVK.

String rendering/rendering_device/driver.linuxbsd = `"vulkan"`

LinuxBSD override for rendering/rendering_device/driver.

Only one option is supported:

  * `vulkan`, Vulkan from native drivers.

Note: If Vulkan was disabled at compile time, there is no alternative
RenderingDevice driver.

String rendering/rendering_device/driver.macos = `"metal"`

macOS override for rendering/rendering_device/driver.

Two options are supported:

  * `metal` (default), Metal from native drivers, only supported on Apple Silicon Macs. On Intel Macs, it will automatically fall back to `vulkan` as Metal support is not implemented.

  * `vulkan`, Vulkan over Metal via MoltenVK, supported on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.

String rendering/rendering_device/driver.windows = `"vulkan"`

Windows override for rendering/rendering_device/driver.

Two options are supported:

  * `vulkan` (default), Vulkan from native drivers. If rendering/rendering_device/fallback_to_vulkan is enabled, this is used as a fallback if Direct3D 12 is not supported.

  * `d3d12`, Direct3D 12 from native drivers. If rendering/rendering_device/fallback_to_d3d12 is enabled, this is used as a fallback if Vulkan is not supported.

bool rendering/rendering_device/fallback_to_d3d12 = `true`

If `true`, the forward renderer will fall back to Direct3D 12 if Vulkan is not
supported. The fallback is always attempted regardless of this setting if
Vulkan driver support was disabled at compile time.

Note: This setting is implemented only on Windows.

bool rendering/rendering_device/fallback_to_opengl3 = `true`

If `true`, the forward renderer will fall back to OpenGL 3 if Direct3D 12,
Metal, and Vulkan are not supported.

Note: This setting is implemented only on Windows, Android, macOS, iOS, and
Linux/X11.

bool rendering/rendering_device/fallback_to_vulkan = `true`

If `true`, the forward renderer will fall back to Vulkan if Direct3D 12 (on
Windows) or Metal (on macOS x86_64) are not supported. The fallback is always
attempted regardless of this setting if Direct3D 12 (Windows) or Metal (macOS)
driver support was disabled at compile time.

Note: This setting is implemented only on Windows and macOS.

bool rendering/rendering_device/pipeline_cache/enable = `true`

Enable the pipeline cache that is saved to disk if the graphics API supports
it.

Note: This property is unable to control the pipeline caching the GPU driver
itself does. Only turn this off along with deleting the contents of the
driver's cache if you wish to simulate the experience a user will get when
starting the game for the first time.

float rendering/rendering_device/pipeline_cache/save_chunk_size_mb = `3.0`

Determines at which interval pipeline cache is saved to disk. The lower the
value, the more often it is saved.

int rendering/rendering_device/staging_buffer/block_size_kb = `256`

The size of a block allocated in the staging buffers. Staging buffers are the
intermediate resources the engine uses to upload or download data to the GPU.
This setting determines the max amount of data that can be transferred in a
copy operation. Increasing this will result in faster data transfers at the
cost of extra memory.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. There is currently
no way to change this value at run-time.

int rendering/rendering_device/staging_buffer/max_size_mb = `128`

The maximum amount of memory allowed to be used by staging buffers. If the
amount of data being uploaded or downloaded exceeds this amount, the GPU will
stall and wait for previous frames to finish.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. There is currently
no way to change this value at run-time.

int rendering/rendering_device/staging_buffer/texture_download_region_size_px
= `64`

The region size in pixels used to download texture data from the GPU when
using methods like RenderingDevice.texture_get_data_async().

Note: This property's upper limit is controlled by
rendering/rendering_device/staging_buffer/block_size_kb and whether it's
possible to allocate a single block of texture data with this region size in
the format that is requested.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. There is currently
no way to change this value at run-time.

int rendering/rendering_device/staging_buffer/texture_upload_region_size_px =
`64`

The region size in pixels used to upload texture data from the GPU when using
methods like RenderingDevice.texture_update().

Note: This property's upper limit is controlled by
rendering/rendering_device/staging_buffer/block_size_kb and whether it's
possible to allocate a single block of texture data with this region size in
the format that is requested.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. There is currently
no way to change this value at run-time.

int rendering/rendering_device/vsync/frame_queue_size = `2`

The number of frames to track on the CPU side before stalling to wait for the
GPU.

Try the V-Sync Simulator, an interactive interface that simulates presentation
to better understand how it is affected by different variables under various
conditions.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. There is currently
no way to change this value at run-time.

int rendering/rendering_device/vsync/swapchain_image_count = `3`

The number of images the swapchain will consist of (back buffers + front
buffer).

`2` corresponds to double-buffering and `3` to triple-buffering.

Double-buffering may give you the lowest lag/latency but if V-Sync is on and
the system can't render at 60 fps, the framerate will go down in multiples of
it (e.g. 30 fps, 15, 7.5, etc.). Triple buffering gives you higher framerate
(specially if the system can't reach a constant 60 fps) at the cost of up to 1
frame of latency, with DisplayServer.VSYNC_ENABLED (FIFO).

Use double-buffering with DisplayServer.VSYNC_ENABLED. Triple-buffering is a
must if you plan on using DisplayServer.VSYNC_MAILBOX mode.

Try the V-Sync Simulator, an interactive interface that simulates presentation
to better understand how it is affected by different variables under various
conditions.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. There is currently
no way to change this value at run-time.

Note: Some platforms may restrict the actual value.

int rendering/rendering_device/vulkan/max_descriptors_per_pool = `64`

The number of descriptors per pool. Godot's Vulkan backend uses linear pools
for descriptors that will be created and destroyed within a single frame.
Instead of destroying every single descriptor every frame, they all can be
destroyed at once by resetting the pool they belong to.

A larger number is more efficient up to a limit, after that it will only waste
RAM (maximum efficiency is achieved when there is no more than 1 pool per
frame). A small number could end up with one pool per descriptor, which
negatively impacts performance.

Note: Changing this property requires a restart to take effect.

float rendering/scaling_3d/fsr_sharpness = `0.2`

Determines how sharp the upscaled image will be when using the FSR upscaling
mode. Sharpness halves with every whole number. Values go from 0.0 (sharpest)
to 2.0. Values above 2.0 won't make a visible difference.

int rendering/scaling_3d/mode = `0`

Sets the scaling 3D mode. Bilinear scaling renders at different resolution to
either undersample or supersample the viewport. FidelityFX Super Resolution
1.0, abbreviated to FSR, is an upscaling technology that produces high quality
images at fast framerates by using a spatially-aware upscaling algorithm. FSR
is slightly more expensive than bilinear, but it produces significantly higher
image quality. On particularly low-end GPUs, the added cost of FSR may not be
worth it (compared to using bilinear scaling with a slightly higher resolution
scale to match performance).

Note: FSR is only effective when using the Forward+ rendering method, not
Mobile or Compatibility. If using an incompatible rendering method, FSR will
fall back to bilinear scaling.

int rendering/scaling_3d/mode.ios

iOS override for rendering/scaling_3d/mode. This allows selecting the MetalFX
spatial and MetalFX temporal scaling modes, which are exclusive to platforms
where the Metal rendering driver is used.

int rendering/scaling_3d/mode.macos

macOS override for rendering/scaling_3d/mode. This allows selecting the
MetalFX spatial and MetalFX temporal scaling modes, which are exclusive to
platforms where the Metal rendering driver is used.

float rendering/scaling_3d/scale = `1.0`

Scales the 3D render buffer based on the viewport size uses an image filter
specified in rendering/scaling_3d/mode to scale the output image to the full
viewport size. Values lower than `1.0` can be used to speed up 3D rendering at
the cost of quality (undersampling). Values greater than `1.0` are only valid
for bilinear mode and can be used to improve 3D rendering quality at a high
performance cost (supersampling). See also
rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/msaa_3d for multi-sample antialiasing, which
is significantly cheaper but only smooths the edges of polygons.

bool rendering/shader_compiler/shader_cache/compress = `true`

There is currently no description for this property. Please help us by
contributing one!

bool rendering/shader_compiler/shader_cache/enabled = `true`

Enable the shader cache, which stores compiled shaders to disk to prevent
stuttering from shader compilation the next time the shader is needed.

bool rendering/shader_compiler/shader_cache/strip_debug = `false`

There is currently no description for this property. Please help us by
contributing one!

bool rendering/shader_compiler/shader_cache/strip_debug.release = `true`

There is currently no description for this property. Please help us by
contributing one!

bool rendering/shader_compiler/shader_cache/use_zstd_compression = `true`

There is currently no description for this property. Please help us by
contributing one!

bool rendering/shading/overrides/force_lambert_over_burley = `false`

If `true`, uses faster but lower-quality Lambert material lighting model
instead of Burley.

bool rendering/shading/overrides/force_lambert_over_burley.mobile = `true`

Lower-end override for rendering/shading/overrides/force_lambert_over_burley
on mobile devices, due to performance concerns or driver support.

bool rendering/shading/overrides/force_vertex_shading = `false`

If `true`, forces vertex shading for all rendering. This can increase
performance a lot, but also reduces quality immensely. Can be used to optimize
performance on low-end mobile devices.

int rendering/textures/canvas_textures/default_texture_filter = `1`

The default texture filtering mode to use for CanvasItems built-in texture. In
shaders, this texture is accessed as `TEXTURE`.

Note: For pixel art aesthetics, see also
rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_vertices_to_pixel and
rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel.

int rendering/textures/canvas_textures/default_texture_repeat = `0`

The default texture repeating mode to use for CanvasItems built-in texture. In
shaders, this texture is accessed as `TEXTURE`.

int rendering/textures/decals/filter = `3`

The filtering quality to use for Decal nodes. When using one of the
anisotropic filtering modes, the anisotropic filtering level is controlled by
rendering/textures/default_filters/anisotropic_filtering_level.

int rendering/textures/default_filters/anisotropic_filtering_level = `2`

Sets the maximum number of samples to take when using anisotropic filtering on
textures (as a power of two). A higher sample count will result in sharper
textures at oblique angles, but is more expensive to compute. A value of `0`
forcibly disables anisotropic filtering, even on materials where it is
enabled.

The anisotropic filtering level also affects decals and light projectors if
they are configured to use anisotropic filtering. See
rendering/textures/decals/filter and
rendering/textures/light_projectors/filter.

Note: In 3D, for this setting to have an effect, set
BaseMaterial3D.texture_filter to
BaseMaterial3D.TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC or
BaseMaterial3D.TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC on materials.

Note: In 2D, for this setting to have an effect, set CanvasItem.texture_filter
to CanvasItem.TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC or
CanvasItem.TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC on the CanvasItem
node displaying the texture (or in CanvasTexture). However, anisotropic
filtering is rarely useful in 2D, so only enable it for textures in 2D if it
makes a meaningful visual difference.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To change the
anisotropic filtering level at runtime, set
Viewport.anisotropic_filtering_level on the root Viewport instead.

float rendering/textures/default_filters/texture_mipmap_bias = `0.0`

Affects the final texture sharpness by reading from a lower or higher mipmap
(also called "texture LOD bias"). Negative values make mipmapped textures
sharper but grainier when viewed at a distance, while positive values make
mipmapped textures blurrier (even when up close).

Enabling temporal antialiasing (rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/use_taa) will
automatically apply a `-0.5` offset to this value, while enabling FXAA
(rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/screen_space_aa) will automatically apply a
`-0.25` offset to this value. If both TAA and FXAA are enabled at the same
time, an offset of `-0.75` is applied to this value.

Note: If rendering/scaling_3d/scale is lower than `1.0` (exclusive),
rendering/textures/default_filters/texture_mipmap_bias is used to adjust the
automatic mipmap bias which is calculated internally based on the scale
factor. The formula for this is `log2(scaling_3d_scale) + mipmap_bias`.

bool rendering/textures/default_filters/use_nearest_mipmap_filter = `false`

If `true`, uses nearest-neighbor mipmap filtering when using mipmaps (also
called "bilinear filtering"), which will result in visible seams appearing
between mipmap stages. This may increase performance in mobile as less memory
bandwidth is used. If `false`, linear mipmap filtering (also called "trilinear
filtering") is used.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. There is currently
no way to change this setting at run-time.

int rendering/textures/light_projectors/filter = `3`

The filtering quality to use for OmniLight3D and SpotLight3D projectors. When
using one of the anisotropic filtering modes, the anisotropic filtering level
is controlled by
rendering/textures/default_filters/anisotropic_filtering_level.

bool rendering/textures/lossless_compression/force_png = `false`

If `true`, the texture importer will import lossless textures using the PNG
format. Otherwise, it will default to using WebP.

bool rendering/textures/vram_compression/cache_gpu_compressor = `true`

If `true`, the GPU texture compressor will cache the local RenderingDevice and
its resources (shaders and pipelines), allowing for faster subsequent imports
at a memory cost.

bool rendering/textures/vram_compression/compress_with_gpu = `true`

If `true`, the texture importer will utilize the GPU for compressing textures,
improving the import time of large images.

Note: This only functions on a device which supports either Vulkan, Direct3D
12, or Metal as a rendering driver.

Note: Currently this only affects certain compressed formats (BC1, BC3, BC4,
BC5, and BC6), all of which are exclusive to desktop platforms and consoles.

bool rendering/textures/vram_compression/import_etc2_astc = `false`

If `true`, the texture importer will import VRAM-compressed textures using the
Ericsson Texture Compression 2 algorithm for lower quality textures and normal
maps and Adaptable Scalable Texture Compression algorithm for high quality
textures (in 44 block size).

Note: This setting is an override. The texture importer will always import the
format the host platform needs, even if this is set to `false`.

Note: Changing this setting does not impact textures that were already
imported before. To make this setting apply to textures that were already
imported, exit the editor, remove the `.godot/imported/` folder located inside
the project folder then restart the editor (see
application/config/use_hidden_project_data_directory).

bool rendering/textures/vram_compression/import_s3tc_bptc = `false`

If `true`, the texture importer will import VRAM-compressed textures using the
S3 Texture Compression algorithm (DXT1-5) for lower quality textures and the
BPTC algorithm (BC6H and BC7) for high quality textures. This algorithm is
only supported on PC desktop platforms and consoles.

Note: This setting is an override. The texture importer will always import the
format the host platform needs, even if this is set to `false`.

Note: Changing this setting does not impact textures that were already
imported before. To make this setting apply to textures that were already
imported, exit the editor, remove the `.godot/imported/` folder located inside
the project folder then restart the editor (see
application/config/use_hidden_project_data_directory).

int rendering/textures/webp_compression/compression_method = `2`

The default compression method for WebP. Affects both lossy and lossless WebP.
A higher value results in smaller files at the cost of compression speed.
Decompression speed is mostly unaffected by the compression method. Supported
values are 0 to 6. Note that compression methods above 4 are very slow and
offer very little savings.

float rendering/textures/webp_compression/lossless_compression_factor = `25`

The default compression factor for lossless WebP. Decompression speed is
mostly unaffected by the compression factor. Supported values are 0 to 100.

bool rendering/viewport/hdr_2d = `false`

If `true`, enables Viewport.use_hdr_2d on the root viewport. 2D rendering will
use an high dynamic range (HDR) format framebuffer matching the bit depth of
the 3D framebuffer. When using the Forward+ renderer this will be an `RGBA16`
framebuffer, while when using the Mobile renderer it will be an `RGB10_A2`
framebuffer. Additionally, 2D rendering will take place in linear color space
and will be converted to sRGB space immediately before blitting to the screen.
Practically speaking, this means that the end result of the Viewport will not
be clamped into the `0-1` range and can be used in 3D rendering without color
space adjustments. This allows 2D rendering to take advantage of effects
requiring high dynamic range (e.g. 2D glow) as well as substantially improves
the appearance of effects requiring highly detailed gradients.

Note: This setting will have no effect when using the Compatibility renderer,
which always renders in low dynamic range for performance reasons.

Note: This property is only read when the project starts. To toggle HDR 2D at
runtime, set Viewport.use_hdr_2d on the root Viewport.

bool rendering/viewport/transparent_background = `false`

If `true`, enables Viewport.transparent_bg on the root viewport. This allows
per-pixel transparency to be effective after also enabling
display/window/size/transparent and
display/window/per_pixel_transparency/allowed.

int rendering/vrs/mode = `0`

Set the default Variable Rate Shading (VRS) mode for the main viewport. See
Viewport.vrs_mode to change this at runtime, and VRSMode for possible values.

String rendering/vrs/texture = `""`

If rendering/vrs/mode is set to Texture, this is the path to default texture
loaded as the VRS image.

The texture must use a lossless compression format so that colors can be
matched precisely. The following VRS densities are mapped to various colors,
with brighter colors representing a lower level of shading precision:

    
    
    - 11 = rgb(0, 0, 0)     - #000000
    - 12 = rgb(0, 85, 0)    - #005500
    - 21 = rgb(85, 0, 0)    - #550000
    - 22 = rgb(85, 85, 0)   - #555500
    - 24 = rgb(85, 170, 0)  - #55aa00
    - 42 = rgb(170, 85, 0)  - #aa5500
    - 44 = rgb(170, 170, 0) - #aaaa00
    - 48 = rgb(170, 255, 0) - #aaff00 - Not supported on most hardware
    - 84 = rgb(255, 170, 0) - #ffaa00 - Not supported on most hardware
    - 88 = rgb(255, 255, 0) - #ffff00 - Not supported on most hardware
    

float threading/worker_pool/low_priority_thread_ratio = `0.3`

The ratio of WorkerThreadPool's threads that will be reserved for low-priority
tasks. For example, if 10 threads are available and this value is set to
`0.3`, 3 of the worker threads will be reserved for low-priority tasks. The
actual value won't exceed the number of CPU cores minus one, and if possible,
at least one worker thread will be dedicated to low-priority tasks.

int threading/worker_pool/max_threads = `-1`

Maximum number of threads to be used by WorkerThreadPool. Value of `-1` means
no limit.

bool xr/openxr/binding_modifiers/analog_threshold = `false`

If `true`, enables the analog threshold binding modifier if supported by the
XR runtime.

bool xr/openxr/binding_modifiers/dpad_binding = `false`

If `true`, enables the D-pad binding modifier if supported by the XR runtime.

String xr/openxr/default_action_map = `"res://openxr_action_map.tres"`

Action map configuration to load by default.

bool xr/openxr/enabled = `false`

If `true`, Godot will setup and initialize OpenXR on startup.

int xr/openxr/environment_blend_mode = `"0"`

Specify how OpenXR should blend in the environment. This is specific to
certain AR and passthrough devices where camera images are blended in by the
XR compositor.

int xr/openxr/extensions/debug_message_types = `"15"`

Specifies the message types for which we request debug messages. Requires
xr/openxr/extensions/debug_utils to be set and the extension to be supported
by the XR runtime.

int xr/openxr/extensions/debug_utils = `"0"`

Enables debug utilities on XR runtimes that supports the debug utils
extension. Sets the maximum severity being reported (0 = disabled, 1 = error,
2 = warning, 3 = info, 4 = verbose).

bool xr/openxr/extensions/eye_gaze_interaction = `false`

Specify whether to enable eye tracking for this project. Depending on the
platform, additional export configuration may be needed.

bool xr/openxr/extensions/hand_interaction_profile = `false`

If `true` the hand interaction profile extension will be activated if
supported by the platform.

bool xr/openxr/extensions/hand_tracking = `false`

If `true`, the hand tracking extension is enabled if available.

Note: By default hand tracking will only work for data sources chosen by the
XR runtime. For SteamVR this is the controller inferred data source, for most
other runtimes this is the unobstructed data source. There is no way to query
this. If a runtime supports the OpenXR data source extension you can use the
xr/openxr/extensions/hand_tracking_controller_data_source and/or
xr/openxr/extensions/hand_tracking_unobstructed_data_source to indicate you
wish to enable these data sources. If neither is selected the data source
extension is not enabled and the XR runtimes default behavior persists.

bool xr/openxr/extensions/hand_tracking_controller_data_source = `false`

If `true`, support for the controller inferred data source is requested. If
supported, you will receive hand tracking data even if the user has a
controller in hand, with finger positions automatically inferred from
controller input and/or sensors.

Node: This requires the OpenXR data source extension and controller inferred
handtracking to be supported by the XR runtime. If not supported this setting
will be ignored. xr/openxr/extensions/hand_tracking must be enabled for this
setting to be used.

bool xr/openxr/extensions/hand_tracking_unobstructed_data_source = `false`

If `true`, support for the unobstructed data source is requested. If
supported, you will receive hand tracking data based on the actual finger
positions of the user often determined by optical tracking.

Node: This requires the OpenXR data source extension and unobstructed
handtracking to be supported by the XR runtime. If not supported this setting
will be ignored. xr/openxr/extensions/hand_tracking must be enabled for this
setting to be used.

int xr/openxr/form_factor = `"0"`

Specify whether OpenXR should be configured for an HMD or a hand held device.

bool xr/openxr/foveation_dynamic = `false`

If `true` and foveation is supported, will automatically adjust foveation
level based on framerate up to the level set on xr/openxr/foveation_level.

Note: Only works on the Compatibility rendering method.

int xr/openxr/foveation_level = `"0"`

Applied foveation level if supported: 0 = off, 1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = high.

Note: Only works on the Compatibility rendering method. On platforms other
than Android, if rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/msaa_3d is enabled, this
feature will be disabled.

int xr/openxr/reference_space = `"1"`

Specify the default reference space.

bool xr/openxr/startup_alert = `true`

If `true`, Godot will display an alert modal when OpenXR initialization fails
on startup.

bool xr/openxr/submit_depth_buffer = `false`

If `true`, OpenXR will manage the depth buffer and use the depth buffer for
advanced reprojection provided this is supported by the XR runtime. Note that
some rendering features in Godot can't be used with this feature.

int xr/openxr/view_configuration = `"1"`

Specify the view configuration with which to configure OpenXR setting up
either Mono or Stereo rendering.

bool xr/shaders/enabled = `false`

If `true`, Godot will compile shaders required for XR.

## Method Descriptions

void add_property_info(hint: Dictionary)

Adds a custom property info to a property. The dictionary must contain:

  * `"name"`: String (the property's name)

  * `"type"`: int (see Variant.Type)

  * optionally `"hint"`: int (see PropertyHint) and `"hint_string"`: String

GDScriptC#

    
    
    ProjectSettings.set("category/property_name", 0)
    
    var property_info = {
        "name": "category/property_name",
        "type": TYPE_INT,
        "hint": PROPERTY_HINT_ENUM,
        "hint_string": "one,two,three"
    }
    
    ProjectSettings.add_property_info(property_info)
    
    
    
    ProjectSettings.Singleton.Set("category/property_name", 0);
    
    var propertyInfo = new Godot.Collections.Dictionary
    {
        {"name", "category/propertyName"},
        {"type", (int)Variant.Type.Int},
        {"hint", (int)PropertyHint.Enum},
        {"hint_string", "one,two,three"},
    };
    
    ProjectSettings.AddPropertyInfo(propertyInfo);
    

void clear(name: String)

Clears the whole configuration (not recommended, may break things).

Array[Dictionary] get_global_class_list()

Returns an Array of registered global classes. Each global class is
represented as a Dictionary that contains the following entries:

  * `base` is a name of the base class;

  * `class` is a name of the registered global class;

  * `icon` is a path to a custom icon of the global class, if it has any;

  * `language` is a name of a programming language in which the global class is written;

  * `path` is a path to a file containing the global class.

Note: Both the script and the icon paths are local to the project filesystem,
i.e. they start with `res://`.

int get_order(name: String) const

Returns the order of a configuration value (influences when saved to the
config file).

Variant get_setting(name: String, default_value: Variant = null) const

Returns the value of the setting identified by `name`. If the setting doesn't
exist and `default_value` is specified, the value of `default_value` is
returned. Otherwise, `null` is returned.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    print(ProjectSettings.get_setting("application/config/name"))
    print(ProjectSettings.get_setting("application/config/custom_description", "No description specified."))
    
    
    
    GD.Print(ProjectSettings.GetSetting("application/config/name"));
    GD.Print(ProjectSettings.GetSetting("application/config/custom_description", "No description specified."));
    

Note: This method doesn't take potential feature overrides into account
automatically. Use get_setting_with_override() to handle seamlessly.

Variant get_setting_with_override(name: StringName) const

Similar to get_setting(), but applies feature tag overrides if any exists and
is valid.

Example: If the setting override `"application/config/name.windows"` exists,
and the following code is executed on a Windows operating system, the
overridden setting is printed instead:

GDScriptC#

    
    
    print(ProjectSettings.get_setting_with_override("application/config/name"))
    
    
    
    GD.Print(ProjectSettings.GetSettingWithOverride("application/config/name"));
    

String globalize_path(path: String) const

Returns the absolute, native OS path corresponding to the localized `path`
(starting with `res://` or `user://`). The returned path will vary depending
on the operating system and user preferences. See File paths in Godot projects
to see what those paths convert to. See also localize_path().

Note: globalize_path() with `res://` will not work in an exported project.
Instead, prepend the executable's base directory to the path when running from
an exported project:

    
    
    var path = ""
    if OS.has_feature("editor"):
        # Running from an editor binary.
        # `path` will contain the absolute path to `hello.txt` located in the project root.
        path = ProjectSettings.globalize_path("res://hello.txt")
    else:
        # Running from an exported project.
        # `path` will contain the absolute path to `hello.txt` next to the executable.
        # This is *not* identical to using `ProjectSettings.globalize_path()` with a `res://` path,
        # but is close enough in spirit.
        path = OS.get_executable_path().get_base_dir().path_join("hello.txt")
    

bool has_setting(name: String) const

Returns `true` if a configuration value is present.

bool load_resource_pack(pack: String, replace_files: bool = true, offset: int
= 0)

Loads the contents of the .pck or .zip file specified by `pack` into the
resource filesystem (`res://`). Returns `true` on success.

Note: If a file from `pack` shares the same path as a file already in the
resource filesystem, any attempts to load that file will use the file from
`pack` unless `replace_files` is set to `false`.

Note: The optional `offset` parameter can be used to specify the offset in
bytes to the start of the resource pack. This is only supported for .pck
files.

Note: DirAccess will not show changes made to the contents of `res://` after
calling this function.

String localize_path(path: String) const

Returns the localized path (starting with `res://`) corresponding to the
absolute, native OS `path`. See also globalize_path().

Error save()

Saves the configuration to the `project.godot` file.

Note: This method is intended to be used by editor plugins, as modified
ProjectSettings can't be loaded back in the running app. If you want to change
project settings in exported projects, use save_custom() to save
`override.cfg` file.

Error save_custom(file: String)

Saves the configuration to a custom file. The file extension must be `.godot`
(to save in text-based ConfigFile format) or `.binary` (to save in binary
format). You can also save `override.cfg` file, which is also text, but can be
used in exported projects unlike other formats.

void set_as_basic(name: String, basic: bool)

Defines if the specified setting is considered basic or advanced. Basic
settings will always be shown in the project settings. Advanced settings will
only be shown if the user enables the "Advanced Settings" option.

void set_as_internal(name: String, internal: bool)

Defines if the specified setting is considered internal. An internal setting
won't show up in the Project Settings dialog. This is mostly useful for addons
that need to store their own internal settings without exposing them directly
to the user.

void set_initial_value(name: String, value: Variant)

Sets the specified setting's initial value. This is the value the setting
reverts to.

void set_order(name: String, position: int)

Sets the order of a configuration value (influences when saved to the config
file).

void set_restart_if_changed(name: String, restart: bool)

Sets whether a setting requires restarting the editor to properly take effect.

Note: This is just a hint to display to the user that the editor must be
restarted for changes to take effect. Enabling set_restart_if_changed() does
not delay the setting being set when changed.

void set_setting(name: String, value: Variant)

Sets the value of a setting.

GDScriptC#

    
    
    ProjectSettings.set_setting("application/config/name", "Example")
    
    
    
    ProjectSettings.SetSetting("application/config/name", "Example");
    

This can also be used to erase custom project settings. To do this change the
setting value to `null`.
