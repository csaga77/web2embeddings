# OpenXRActionSet

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

Collection of OpenXRAction resources that make up an action set.

## Description

Action sets in OpenXR define a collection of actions that can be activated in
unison. This allows games to easily change between different states that
require different inputs or need to reinterpret inputs. For instance we could
have an action set that is active when a menu is open, an action set that is
active when the player is freely walking around and an action set that is
active when the player is controlling a vehicle.

Action sets can contain the same action with the same name, if such action
sets are active at the same time the action set with the highest priority
defines which binding is active.
