Base class for reference-counted objects.

## Description

Base class for any object that keeps a reference count. Resource and many
other helper objects inherit this class.

Unlike other Object types, RefCounteds keep an internal reference counter so
that they are automatically released when no longer in use, and only then.
RefCounteds therefore do not need to be freed manually with Object.free().

RefCounted instances caught in a cyclic reference will not be freed
automatically. For example, if a node holds a reference to instance `A`, which
directly or indirectly holds a reference back to `A`, `A`'s reference count
will be 2. Destruction of the node will leave `A` dangling with a reference
count of 1, and there will be a memory leak. To prevent this, one of the
references in the cycle can be made weak with @GlobalScope.weakref().

In the vast majority of use cases, instantiating and using RefCounted-derived
types is all you need to do. The methods provided in this class are only for
advanced users, and can cause issues if misused.

Note: In C#, reference-counted objects will not be freed instantly after they
are no longer in use. Instead, garbage collection will run periodically and
will free reference-counted objects that are no longer in use. This means that
unused ones will remain in memory for a while before being removed.

---|---  
bool | init_ref()  
bool | reference()  
bool | unreference()  
  
## Method Descriptions

int get_reference_count() const

Returns the current reference count.

bool init_ref()

Initializes the internal reference counter. Use this only if you really know
what you are doing.

Returns whether the initialization was successful.

bool reference()

Increments the internal reference counter. Use this only if you really know
what you are doing.

Returns `true` if the increment was successful, `false` otherwise.

bool unreference()

Decrements the internal reference counter. Use this only if you really know
what you are doing.

Returns `true` if the object should be freed after the decrement, `false`
otherwise.
