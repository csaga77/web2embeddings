# GradientTexture1D

Inherits: Texture2D < Texture < Resource < RefCounted < Object

A 1D texture that uses colors obtained from a Gradient.

## Description

A 1D texture that obtains colors from a Gradient to fill the texture data. The
texture is filled by sampling the gradient for each pixel. Therefore, the
texture does not necessarily represent an exact copy of the gradient, as it
may miss some colors if there are not enough pixels. See also
GradientTexture2D, CurveTexture and CurveXYZTexture.

## Properties

Gradient | gradient  
---|---  
bool | resource_local_to_scene | `false` (overrides Resource)  
bool | use_hdr | `false`  
int | width | `256`  
  
## Property Descriptions

Gradient gradient

  * void set_gradient(value: Gradient)

  * Gradient get_gradient()

The Gradient used to fill the texture.

bool use_hdr = `false`

  * void set_use_hdr(value: bool)

  * bool is_using_hdr()

If `true`, the generated texture will support high dynamic range
(Image.FORMAT_RGBAF format). This allows for glow effects to work if
Environment.glow_enabled is `true`. If `false`, the generated texture will use
low dynamic range; overbright colors will be clamped (Image.FORMAT_RGBA8
format).

int width = `256`

  * void set_width(value: int)

  * int get_width()

The number of color samples that will be obtained from the Gradient.
