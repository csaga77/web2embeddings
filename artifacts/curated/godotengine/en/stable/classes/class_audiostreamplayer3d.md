# AudioStreamPlayer3D

Inherits: Node3D < Node < Object

Plays positional sound in 3D space.

## Description

Plays audio with positional sound effects, based on the relative position of
the audio listener. Positional effects include distance attenuation,
directionality, and the Doppler effect. For greater realism, a low-pass filter
is applied to distant sounds. This can be disabled by setting
attenuation_filter_cutoff_hz to `20500`.

By default, audio is heard from the camera position. This can be changed by
adding an AudioListener3D node to the scene and enabling it by calling
AudioListener3D.make_current() on it.

See also AudioStreamPlayer to play a sound non-positionally.

Note: Hiding an AudioStreamPlayer3D node does not disable its audio output. To
temporarily disable an AudioStreamPlayer3D's audio output, set volume_db to a
very low value like `-100` (which isn't audible to human hearing).

## Enumerations

enum AttenuationModel:

AttenuationModel ATTENUATION_INVERSE_DISTANCE = `0`

Attenuation of loudness according to linear distance.

AttenuationModel ATTENUATION_INVERSE_SQUARE_DISTANCE = `1`

Attenuation of loudness according to squared distance.

AttenuationModel ATTENUATION_LOGARITHMIC = `2`

Attenuation of loudness according to logarithmic distance.

AttenuationModel ATTENUATION_DISABLED = `3`

No attenuation of loudness according to distance. The sound will still be
heard positionally, unlike an AudioStreamPlayer. ATTENUATION_DISABLED can be
combined with a max_distance value greater than `0.0` to achieve linear
attenuation clamped to a sphere of a defined size.

enum DopplerTracking:

DopplerTracking DOPPLER_TRACKING_DISABLED = `0`

Disables doppler tracking.

DopplerTracking DOPPLER_TRACKING_IDLE_STEP = `1`

Executes doppler tracking during process frames (see
Node.NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_PROCESS).

DopplerTracking DOPPLER_TRACKING_PHYSICS_STEP = `2`

Executes doppler tracking during physics frames (see
Node.NOTIFICATION_INTERNAL_PHYSICS_PROCESS).

## Property Descriptions

int area_mask = `1`

  * void set_area_mask(value: int)

  * int get_area_mask()

Determines which Area3D layers affect the sound for reverb and audio bus
effects. Areas can be used to redirect AudioStreams so that they play in a
certain audio bus. An example of how you might use this is making a "water"
area so that sounds played in the water are redirected through an audio bus to
make them sound like they are being played underwater.

float attenuation_filter_cutoff_hz = `5000.0`

  * void set_attenuation_filter_cutoff_hz(value: float)

  * float get_attenuation_filter_cutoff_hz()

The cutoff frequency of the attenuation low-pass filter, in Hz. A sound above
this frequency is attenuated more than a sound below this frequency. To
disable this effect, set this to `20500` as this frequency is above the human
hearing limit.

float attenuation_filter_db = `-24.0`

  * void set_attenuation_filter_db(value: float)

  * float get_attenuation_filter_db()

Amount how much the filter affects the loudness, in decibels.

AttenuationModel attenuation_model = `0`

  * void set_attenuation_model(value: AttenuationModel)

  * AttenuationModel get_attenuation_model()

Decides if audio should get quieter with distance linearly, quadratically,
logarithmically, or not be affected by distance, effectively disabling
attenuation.

bool autoplay = `false`

  * void set_autoplay(value: bool)

  * bool is_autoplay_enabled()

If `true`, audio plays when the AudioStreamPlayer3D node is added to scene
tree.

StringName bus = `&"Master"`

  * void set_bus(value: StringName)

  * StringName get_bus()

The bus on which this audio is playing.

Note: When setting this property, keep in mind that no validation is performed
to see if the given name matches an existing bus. This is because audio bus
layouts might be loaded after this property is set. If this given name can't
be resolved at runtime, it will fall back to `"Master"`.

DopplerTracking doppler_tracking = `0`

  * void set_doppler_tracking(value: DopplerTracking)

  * DopplerTracking get_doppler_tracking()

Decides in which step the Doppler effect should be calculated.

float emission_angle_degrees = `45.0`

  * void set_emission_angle(value: float)

  * float get_emission_angle()

The angle in which the audio reaches a listener unattenuated.

bool emission_angle_enabled = `false`

  * void set_emission_angle_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_emission_angle_enabled()

If `true`, the audio should be attenuated according to the direction of the
sound.

float emission_angle_filter_attenuation_db = `-12.0`

  * void set_emission_angle_filter_attenuation_db(value: float)

  * float get_emission_angle_filter_attenuation_db()

Attenuation factor used if listener is outside of emission_angle_degrees and
emission_angle_enabled is set, in decibels.

float max_db = `3.0`

  * void set_max_db(value: float)

  * float get_max_db()

Sets the absolute maximum of the sound level, in decibels.

float max_distance = `0.0`

  * void set_max_distance(value: float)

  * float get_max_distance()

The distance past which the sound can no longer be heard at all. Only has an
effect if set to a value greater than `0.0`. max_distance works in tandem with
unit_size. However, unlike unit_size whose behavior depends on the
attenuation_model, max_distance always works in a linear fashion. This can be
used to prevent the AudioStreamPlayer3D from requiring audio mixing when the
listener is far away, which saves CPU resources.

int max_polyphony = `1`

  * void set_max_polyphony(value: int)

  * int get_max_polyphony()

The maximum number of sounds this node can play at the same time. Playing
additional sounds after this value is reached will cut off the oldest sounds.

float panning_strength = `1.0`

  * void set_panning_strength(value: float)

  * float get_panning_strength()

Scales the panning strength for this node by multiplying the base
ProjectSettings.audio/general/3d_panning_strength with this factor. Higher
values will pan audio from left to right more dramatically than lower values.

float pitch_scale = `1.0`

  * void set_pitch_scale(value: float)

  * float get_pitch_scale()

The pitch and the tempo of the audio, as a multiplier of the audio sample's
sample rate.

PlaybackType playback_type = `0`

  * void set_playback_type(value: PlaybackType)

  * PlaybackType get_playback_type()

Experimental: This property may be changed or removed in future versions.

The playback type of the stream player. If set other than to the default
value, it will force that playback type.

bool playing = `false`

  * void set_playing(value: bool)

  * bool is_playing()

If `true`, audio is playing or is queued to be played (see play()).

AudioStream stream

  * void set_stream(value: AudioStream)

  * AudioStream get_stream()

The AudioStream resource to be played.

bool stream_paused = `false`

  * void set_stream_paused(value: bool)

  * bool get_stream_paused()

If `true`, the playback is paused. You can resume it by setting stream_paused
to `false`.

float unit_size = `10.0`

  * void set_unit_size(value: float)

  * float get_unit_size()

The factor for the attenuation effect. Higher values make the sound audible
over a larger distance.

float volume_db = `0.0`

  * void set_volume_db(value: float)

  * float get_volume_db()

The base sound level before attenuation, in decibels.

float volume_linear

  * void set_volume_linear(value: float)

  * float get_volume_linear()

The base sound level before attenuation, as a linear value.

Note: This member modifies volume_db for convenience. The returned value is
equivalent to the result of @GlobalScope.db_to_linear() on volume_db. Setting
this member is equivalent to setting volume_db to the result of
@GlobalScope.linear_to_db() on a value.
