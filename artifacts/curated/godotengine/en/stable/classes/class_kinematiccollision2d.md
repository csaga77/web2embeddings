# KinematicCollision2D

Inherits: RefCounted < Object

Holds collision data from the movement of a PhysicsBody2D.

## Description

Holds collision data from the movement of a PhysicsBody2D, usually from
PhysicsBody2D.move_and_collide(). When a PhysicsBody2D is moved, it stops if
it detects a collision with another body. If a collision is detected, a
KinematicCollision2D object is returned.

The collision data includes the colliding object, the remaining motion, and
the collision position. This data can be used to determine a custom response
to the collision.

## Method Descriptions

float get_angle(up_direction: Vector2 = Vector2(0, -1)) const

Returns the collision angle according to `up_direction`, which is Vector2.UP
by default. This value is always positive.

Object get_collider() const

Returns the colliding body's attached Object.

int get_collider_id() const

Returns the unique instance ID of the colliding body's attached Object. See
Object.get_instance_id().

RID get_collider_rid() const

Returns the colliding body's RID used by the PhysicsServer2D.

Object get_collider_shape() const

Returns the colliding body's shape.

int get_collider_shape_index() const

Returns the colliding body's shape index. See CollisionObject2D.

Vector2 get_collider_velocity() const

Returns the colliding body's velocity.

float get_depth() const

Returns the colliding body's length of overlap along the collision normal.

Object get_local_shape() const

Returns the moving object's colliding shape.

Vector2 get_normal() const

Returns the colliding body's shape's normal at the point of collision.

Vector2 get_position() const

Returns the point of collision in global coordinates.

Vector2 get_remainder() const

Returns the moving object's remaining movement vector.

Vector2 get_travel() const

Returns the moving object's travel before collision.
