# OggPacketSequence

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

A sequence of Ogg packets.

## Description

A sequence of Ogg packets.

## Properties

PackedInt64Array | granule_positions | `PackedInt64Array()`  
---|---|---  
Array[Array] | packet_data | `[]`  
float | sampling_rate | `0.0`  
  
## Methods

float | get_length() const  
---|---  
  
## Property Descriptions

PackedInt64Array granule_positions = `PackedInt64Array()`

  * void set_packet_granule_positions(value: PackedInt64Array)

  * PackedInt64Array get_packet_granule_positions()

Contains the granule positions for each page in this packet sequence.

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedInt64Array for more details.

Array[Array] packet_data = `[]`

  * void set_packet_data(value: Array[Array])

  * Array[Array] get_packet_data()

Contains the raw packets that make up this OggPacketSequence.

float sampling_rate = `0.0`

  * void set_sampling_rate(value: float)

  * float get_sampling_rate()

Holds sample rate information about this sequence. Must be set by another
class that actually understands the codec.

## Method Descriptions

float get_length() const

The length of this stream, in seconds.
