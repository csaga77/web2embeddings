# BitMap

Inherits: Resource < RefCounted < Object

Boolean matrix.

## Description

A two-dimensional array of boolean values, can be used to efficiently store a
binary matrix (every matrix element takes only one bit) and query the values
using natural cartesian coordinates.

## Method Descriptions

Image convert_to_image() const

Returns an image of the same size as the bitmap and with a Format of type
Image.FORMAT_L8. `true` bits of the bitmap are being converted into white
pixels, and `false` bits into black.

void create(size: Vector2i)

Creates a bitmap with the specified size, filled with `false`.

void create_from_image_alpha(image: Image, threshold: float = 0.1)

Creates a bitmap that matches the given image dimensions, every element of the
bitmap is set to `false` if the alpha value of the image at that position is
equal to `threshold` or less, and `true` in other case.

bool get_bit(x: int, y: int) const

Returns bitmap's value at the specified position.

bool get_bitv(position: Vector2i) const

Returns bitmap's value at the specified position.

Vector2i get_size() const

Returns bitmap's dimensions.

int get_true_bit_count() const

Returns the number of bitmap elements that are set to `true`.

void grow_mask(pixels: int, rect: Rect2i)

Applies morphological dilation or erosion to the bitmap. If `pixels` is
positive, dilation is applied to the bitmap. If `pixels` is negative, erosion
is applied to the bitmap. `rect` defines the area where the morphological
operation is applied. Pixels located outside the `rect` are unaffected by
grow_mask().

Array[PackedVector2Array] opaque_to_polygons(rect: Rect2i, epsilon: float =
2.0) const

Creates an Array of polygons covering a rectangular portion of the bitmap. It
uses a marching squares algorithm, followed by Ramer-Douglas-Peucker (RDP)
reduction of the number of vertices. Each polygon is described as a
PackedVector2Array of its vertices.

To get polygons covering the whole bitmap, pass:

    
    
    Rect2(Vector2(), get_size())
    

`epsilon` is passed to RDP to control how accurately the polygons cover the
bitmap: a lower `epsilon` corresponds to more points in the polygons.

void resize(new_size: Vector2i)

Resizes the image to `new_size`.

void set_bit(x: int, y: int, bit: bool)

Sets the bitmap's element at the specified position, to the specified value.

void set_bit_rect(rect: Rect2i, bit: bool)

Sets a rectangular portion of the bitmap to the specified value.

void set_bitv(position: Vector2i, bit: bool)

Sets the bitmap's element at the specified position, to the specified value.
