# PacketPeerDTLS

Inherits: PacketPeer < RefCounted < Object

DTLS packet peer.

## Description

This class represents a DTLS peer connection. It can be used to connect to a
DTLS server, and is returned by DTLSServer.take_connection().

Note: When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the `INTERNET` permission
in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click
deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by
Android.

Warning: TLS certificate revocation and certificate pinning are currently not
supported. Revoked certificates are accepted as long as they are otherwise
valid. If this is a concern, you may want to use automatically managed
certificates with a short validity period.

## Enumerations

enum Status:

Status STATUS_DISCONNECTED = `0`

A status representing a PacketPeerDTLS that is disconnected.

Status STATUS_HANDSHAKING = `1`

A status representing a PacketPeerDTLS that is currently performing the
handshake with a remote peer.

Status STATUS_CONNECTED = `2`

A status representing a PacketPeerDTLS that is connected to a remote peer.

Status STATUS_ERROR = `3`

A status representing a PacketPeerDTLS in a generic error state.

Status STATUS_ERROR_HOSTNAME_MISMATCH = `4`

An error status that shows a mismatch in the DTLS certificate domain presented
by the host and the domain requested for validation.

## Method Descriptions

Error connect_to_peer(packet_peer: PacketPeerUDP, hostname: String,
client_options: TLSOptions = null)

Connects a `packet_peer` beginning the DTLS handshake using the underlying
PacketPeerUDP which must be connected (see PacketPeerUDP.connect_to_host()).
You can optionally specify the `client_options` to be used while verifying the
TLS connections. See TLSOptions.client() and TLSOptions.client_unsafe().

void disconnect_from_peer()

Disconnects this peer, terminating the DTLS session.

Status get_status() const

Returns the status of the connection. See Status for values.

void poll()

Poll the connection to check for incoming packets. Call this frequently to
update the status and keep the connection working.
