# PathFollow3D

Inherits: Node3D < Node < Object

Point sampler for a Path3D.

## Description

This node takes its parent Path3D, and returns the coordinates of a point
within it, given a distance from the first vertex.

It is useful for making other nodes follow a path, without coding the movement
pattern. For that, the nodes must be children of this node. The descendant
nodes will then move accordingly when setting the progress in this node.

## Enumerations

enum RotationMode:

RotationMode ROTATION_NONE = `0`

Forbids the PathFollow3D to rotate.

RotationMode ROTATION_Y = `1`

Allows the PathFollow3D to rotate in the Y axis only.

RotationMode ROTATION_XY = `2`

Allows the PathFollow3D to rotate in both the X, and Y axes.

RotationMode ROTATION_XYZ = `3`

Allows the PathFollow3D to rotate in any axis.

RotationMode ROTATION_ORIENTED = `4`

Uses the up vector information in a Curve3D to enforce orientation. This
rotation mode requires the Path3D's Curve3D.up_vector_enabled property to be
set to `true`.

## Property Descriptions

bool cubic_interp = `true`

  * void set_cubic_interpolation(value: bool)

  * bool get_cubic_interpolation()

If `true`, the position between two cached points is interpolated cubically,
and linearly otherwise.

The points along the Curve3D of the Path3D are precomputed before use, for
faster calculations. The point at the requested offset is then calculated
interpolating between two adjacent cached points. This may present a problem
if the curve makes sharp turns, as the cached points may not follow the curve
closely enough.

There are two answers to this problem: either increase the number of cached
points and increase memory consumption, or make a cubic interpolation between
two points at the cost of (slightly) slower calculations.

float h_offset = `0.0`

  * void set_h_offset(value: float)

  * float get_h_offset()

The node's offset along the curve.

bool loop = `true`

  * void set_loop(value: bool)

  * bool has_loop()

If `true`, any offset outside the path's length will wrap around, instead of
stopping at the ends. Use it for cyclic paths.

float progress = `0.0`

  * void set_progress(value: float)

  * float get_progress()

The distance from the first vertex, measured in 3D units along the path.
Changing this value sets this node's position to a point within the path.

float progress_ratio = `0.0`

  * void set_progress_ratio(value: float)

  * float get_progress_ratio()

The distance from the first vertex, considering 0.0 as the first vertex and
1.0 as the last. This is just another way of expressing the progress within
the path, as the progress supplied is multiplied internally by the path's
length.

It can be set or get only if the PathFollow3D is the child of a Path3D which
is part of the scene tree, and that this Path3D has a Curve3D with a non-zero
length. Otherwise, trying to set this field will print an error, and getting
this field will return `0.0`.

RotationMode rotation_mode = `3`

  * void set_rotation_mode(value: RotationMode)

  * RotationMode get_rotation_mode()

Allows or forbids rotation on one or more axes, depending on the RotationMode
constants being used.

bool tilt_enabled = `true`

  * void set_tilt_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_tilt_enabled()

If `true`, the tilt property of Curve3D takes effect.

bool use_model_front = `false`

  * void set_use_model_front(value: bool)

  * bool is_using_model_front()

If `true`, the node moves on the travel path with orienting the +Z axis as
forward. See also Vector3.FORWARD and Vector3.MODEL_FRONT.

float v_offset = `0.0`

  * void set_v_offset(value: float)

  * float get_v_offset()

The node's offset perpendicular to the curve.

## Method Descriptions

Transform3D correct_posture(transform: Transform3D, rotation_mode:
RotationMode) static

Correct the `transform`. `rotation_mode` implicitly specifies how posture
(forward, up and sideway direction) is calculated.
