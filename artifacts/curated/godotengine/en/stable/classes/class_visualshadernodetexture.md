# VisualShaderNodeTexture

Inherits: VisualShaderNode < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Performs a 2D texture lookup within the visual shader graph.

## Description

Performs a lookup operation on the provided texture, with support for multiple
texture sources to choose from.

## Properties

Source | source | `0`  
---|---|---  
Texture2D | texture  
TextureType | texture_type | `0`  
  
## Enumerations

enum Source:

Source SOURCE_TEXTURE = `0`

Use the texture given as an argument for this function.

Source SOURCE_SCREEN = `1`

Use the current viewport's texture as the source.

Source SOURCE_2D_TEXTURE = `2`

Use the texture from this shader's texture built-in (e.g. a texture of a
Sprite2D).

Source SOURCE_2D_NORMAL = `3`

Use the texture from this shader's normal map built-in.

Source SOURCE_DEPTH = `4`

Use the depth texture captured during the depth prepass. Only available when
the depth prepass is used (i.e. in spatial shaders and in the forward_plus or
gl_compatibility renderers).

Source SOURCE_PORT = `5`

Use the texture provided in the input port for this function.

Source SOURCE_3D_NORMAL = `6`

Use the normal buffer captured during the depth prepass. Only available when
the normal-roughness buffer is available (i.e. in spatial shaders and in the
forward_plus renderer).

Source SOURCE_ROUGHNESS = `7`

Use the roughness buffer captured during the depth prepass. Only available
when the normal-roughness buffer is available (i.e. in spatial shaders and in
the forward_plus renderer).

Source SOURCE_MAX = `8`

Represents the size of the Source enum.

enum TextureType:

TextureType TYPE_DATA = `0`

No hints are added to the uniform declaration.

TextureType TYPE_COLOR = `1`

Adds `source_color` as hint to the uniform declaration for proper sRGB to
linear conversion.

TextureType TYPE_NORMAL_MAP = `2`

Adds `hint_normal` as hint to the uniform declaration, which internally
converts the texture for proper usage as normal map.

TextureType TYPE_MAX = `3`

Represents the size of the TextureType enum.

## Property Descriptions

Source source = `0`

  * void set_source(value: Source)

  * Source get_source()

Determines the source for the lookup. See Source for options.

Texture2D texture

  * void set_texture(value: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture()

The source texture, if needed for the selected source.

TextureType texture_type = `0`

  * void set_texture_type(value: TextureType)

  * TextureType get_texture_type()

Specifies the type of the texture if source is set to SOURCE_TEXTURE. See
TextureType for options.
