## Property Descriptions

RID canvas

  * RID get_canvas()

The RID of this world's canvas resource. Used by the RenderingServer for 2D
drawing.

Direct access to the world's physics 2D space state. Used for querying current
and potential collisions. When using multi-threaded physics, access is limited
to Node._physics_process() in the main thread.

RID navigation_map

  * RID get_navigation_map()

The RID of this world's navigation map. Used by the NavigationServer2D.

RID space

  * RID get_space()

The RID of this world's physics space resource. Used by the PhysicsServer2D
