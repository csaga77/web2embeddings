# MultiplayerSpawner

Inherits: Node < Object

Automatically replicates spawnable nodes from the authority to other
multiplayer peers.

## Description

Spawnable scenes can be configured in the editor or through code (see
add_spawnable_scene()).

Also supports custom node spawns through spawn(), calling spawn_function on
all peers.

Internally, MultiplayerSpawner uses MultiplayerAPI.object_configuration_add()
to notify spawns passing the spawned node as the `object` and itself as the
`configuration`, and MultiplayerAPI.object_configuration_remove() to notify
despawns in a similar way.

## Properties

Callable | spawn_function  
---|---  
int | spawn_limit | `0`  
NodePath | spawn_path | `NodePath("")`  
  
## Methods

void | add_spawnable_scene(path: String)  
---|---  
void | clear_spawnable_scenes()  
String | get_spawnable_scene(index: int) const  
int | get_spawnable_scene_count() const  
Node | spawn(data: Variant = null)  
  
## Signals

despawned(node: Node)

Emitted when a spawnable scene or custom spawn was despawned by the
multiplayer authority. Only called on remote peers.

spawned(node: Node)

Emitted when a spawnable scene or custom spawn was spawned by the multiplayer
authority. Only called on remote peers.

## Property Descriptions

Callable spawn_function

  * void set_spawn_function(value: Callable)

  * Callable get_spawn_function()

Method called on all peers when a custom spawn() is requested by the
authority. Will receive the `data` parameter, and should return a Node that is
not in the scene tree.

Note: The returned node should not be added to the scene with
Node.add_child(). This is done automatically.

int spawn_limit = `0`

  * void set_spawn_limit(value: int)

  * int get_spawn_limit()

Maximum number of nodes allowed to be spawned by this spawner. Includes both
spawnable scenes and custom spawns.

When set to `0` (the default), there is no limit.

NodePath spawn_path = `NodePath("")`

  * void set_spawn_path(value: NodePath)

  * NodePath get_spawn_path()

Path to the spawn root. Spawnable scenes that are added as direct children are
replicated to other peers.

## Method Descriptions

void add_spawnable_scene(path: String)

Adds a scene path to spawnable scenes, making it automatically replicated from
the multiplayer authority to other peers when added as children of the node
pointed by spawn_path.

void clear_spawnable_scenes()

Clears all spawnable scenes. Does not despawn existing instances on remote
peers.

String get_spawnable_scene(index: int) const

Returns the spawnable scene path by index.

int get_spawnable_scene_count() const

Returns the count of spawnable scene paths.

Node spawn(data: Variant = null)

Requests a custom spawn, with `data` passed to spawn_function on all peers.
Returns the locally spawned node instance already inside the scene tree, and
added as a child of the node pointed by spawn_path.

Note: Spawnable scenes are spawned automatically. spawn() is only needed for
custom spawns.
