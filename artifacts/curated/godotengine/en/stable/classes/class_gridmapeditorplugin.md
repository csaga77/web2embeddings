## Method Descriptions

void clear_selection()

Deselects any currently selected cells.

GridMap get_current_grid_map() const

Returns the GridMap node currently edited by the grid map editor.

Array get_selected_cells() const

Returns an array of Vector3is with the selected cells' coordinates.

int get_selected_palette_item() const

Returns the index of the selected MeshLibrary item in the grid map editor's
palette or `-1` if no item is selected.

Note: The indices might not be in the same order as they appear in the
editor's interface.

AABB get_selection() const

Returns the cell coordinate bounds of the current selection. Use
has_selection() to check if there is an active selection.

bool has_selection() const

Returns `true` if there are selected cells.

void set_selected_palette_item(item: int) const

Selects the MeshLibrary item with the given index in the grid map editor's
palette. If a negative index is given, no item will be selected. If a value
greater than the last index is given, the last item will be selected.

Note: The indices might not be in the same order as they appear in the
editor's interface.

void set_selection(begin: Vector3i, end: Vector3i)

Selects the cells inside the given bounds from `begin` to `end`.
