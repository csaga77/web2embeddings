# StreamPeerTLS

Inherits: StreamPeer < RefCounted < Object

A stream peer that handles TLS connections.

## Description

A stream peer that handles TLS connections. This object can be used to connect
to a TLS server or accept a single TLS client connection.

Note: When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the `INTERNET` permission
in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click
deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by
Android.

## Enumerations

enum Status:

Status STATUS_DISCONNECTED = `0`

A status representing a StreamPeerTLS that is disconnected.

Status STATUS_HANDSHAKING = `1`

A status representing a StreamPeerTLS during handshaking.

Status STATUS_CONNECTED = `2`

A status representing a StreamPeerTLS that is connected to a host.

Status STATUS_ERROR = `3`

A status representing a StreamPeerTLS in error state.

Status STATUS_ERROR_HOSTNAME_MISMATCH = `4`

An error status that shows a mismatch in the TLS certificate domain presented
by the host and the domain requested for validation.

## Method Descriptions

Error accept_stream(stream: StreamPeer, server_options: TLSOptions)

Accepts a peer connection as a server using the given `server_options`. See
TLSOptions.server().

Error connect_to_stream(stream: StreamPeer, common_name: String,
client_options: TLSOptions = null)

Connects to a peer using an underlying StreamPeer `stream` and verifying the
remote certificate is correctly signed for the given `common_name`. You can
pass the optional `client_options` parameter to customize the trusted
certification authorities, or disable the common name verification. See
TLSOptions.client() and TLSOptions.client_unsafe().

void disconnect_from_stream()

Disconnects from host.

Status get_status() const

Returns the status of the connection. See Status for values.

StreamPeer get_stream() const

Returns the underlying StreamPeer connection, used in accept_stream() or
connect_to_stream().

void poll()

Poll the connection to check for incoming bytes. Call this right before
StreamPeer.get_available_bytes() for it to work properly.
