# InputEventMouseMotion

Inherits: InputEventMouse < InputEventWithModifiers < InputEventFromWindow <
InputEvent < Resource < RefCounted < Object

Represents a mouse or a pen movement.

## Description

Stores information about a mouse or a pen motion. This includes relative
position, absolute position, and velocity. See Node._input().

Note: By default, this event is only emitted once per frame rendered at most.
If you need more precise input reporting, set Input.use_accumulated_input to
`false` to make events emitted as often as possible. If you use
InputEventMouseMotion to draw lines, consider using
Geometry2D.bresenham_line() as well to avoid visible gaps in lines if the user
is moving the mouse quickly.

Note: This event may be emitted even when the mouse hasn't moved, either by
the operating system or by Godot itself. If you really need to know if the
mouse has moved (e.g. to suppress displaying a tooltip), you should check that
`relative.is_zero_approx()` is `false`.

Vector2 | tilt | `Vector2(0, 0)`  
Vector2 | velocity | `Vector2(0, 0)`  
  
## Property Descriptions

bool pen_inverted = `false`

  * void set_pen_inverted(value: bool)

  * bool get_pen_inverted()

Returns `true` when using the eraser end of a stylus pen.

Note: This property is implemented on Linux, macOS and Windows.

float pressure = `0.0`

  * void set_pressure(value: float)

  * float get_pressure()

Represents the pressure the user puts on the pen. Ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`.

Vector2 relative = `Vector2(0, 0)`

  * void set_relative(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_relative()

The mouse position relative to the previous position (position at the last
frame).

Note: Since InputEventMouseMotion may only be emitted when the mouse moves, it
is not possible to reliably detect when the mouse has stopped moving by
checking this property. A separate, short timer may be necessary.

Note: relative is automatically scaled according to the content scale factor,
which is defined by the project's stretch mode settings. This means mouse
sensitivity will appear different depending on resolution when using relative
in a script that handles mouse aiming with the Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED mouse
mode. To avoid this, use screen_relative instead.

Vector2 screen_relative = `Vector2(0, 0)`

  * void set_screen_relative(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_screen_relative()

The unscaled mouse position relative to the previous position in the
coordinate system of the screen (position at the last frame).

Note: Since InputEventMouseMotion may only be emitted when the mouse moves, it
is not possible to reliably detect when the mouse has stopped moving by
checking this property. A separate, short timer may be necessary.

Note: This coordinate is not scaled according to the content scale factor or
calls to InputEvent.xformed_by(). This should be preferred over relative for
mouse aiming when using the Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED mouse mode, regardless
of the project's stretch mode.

Vector2 screen_velocity = `Vector2(0, 0)`

  * void set_screen_velocity(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_screen_velocity()

The unscaled mouse velocity in pixels per second in screen coordinates. This
velocity is not scaled according to the content scale factor or calls to
InputEvent.xformed_by(). This should be preferred over velocity for mouse
aiming when using the Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED mouse mode, regardless of the
project's stretch mode.

Vector2 tilt = `Vector2(0, 0)`

  * void set_tilt(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_tilt()

Represents the angles of tilt of the pen. Positive X-coordinate value
indicates a tilt to the right. Positive Y-coordinate value indicates a tilt
toward the user. Ranges from `-1.0` to `1.0` for both axes.

Vector2 velocity = `Vector2(0, 0)`

  * void set_velocity(value: Vector2)

  * Vector2 get_velocity()

The mouse velocity in pixels per second.

Note: velocity is automatically scaled according to the content scale factor,
which is defined by the project's stretch mode settings. This means mouse
sensitivity will appear different depending on resolution when using velocity
in a script that handles mouse aiming with the Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED mouse
mode. To avoid this, use screen_velocity instead.
