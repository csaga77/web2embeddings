# WebSocketPeer

Inherits: PacketPeer < RefCounted < Object

A WebSocket connection.

## Description

This class represents WebSocket connection, and can be used as a WebSocket
client (RFC 6455-compliant) or as a remote peer of a WebSocket server.

You can send WebSocket binary frames using PacketPeer.put_packet(), and
WebSocket text frames using send() (prefer text frames when interacting with
text-based API). You can check the frame type of the last packet via
was_string_packet().

To start a WebSocket client, first call connect_to_url(), then regularly call
poll() (e.g. during Node process). You can query the socket state via
get_ready_state(), get the number of pending packets using
PacketPeer.get_available_packet_count(), and retrieve them via
PacketPeer.get_packet().

GDScript

    
    
    extends Node
    
    var socket = WebSocketPeer.new()
    
    func _ready():
        socket.connect_to_url("wss://example.com")
    
    func _process(delta):
        socket.poll()
        var state = socket.get_ready_state()
        if state == WebSocketPeer.STATE_OPEN:
            while socket.get_available_packet_count():
                print("Packet: ", socket.get_packet())
        elif state == WebSocketPeer.STATE_CLOSING:
            # Keep polling to achieve proper close.
            pass
        elif state == WebSocketPeer.STATE_CLOSED:
            var code = socket.get_close_code()
            var reason = socket.get_close_reason()
            print("WebSocket closed with code: %d, reason %s. Clean: %s" % [code, reason, code != -1])
            set_process(false) # Stop processing.
    

To use the peer as part of a WebSocket server refer to accept_stream() and the
online tutorial.

## Enumerations

enum WriteMode:

WriteMode WRITE_MODE_TEXT = `0`

Specifies that WebSockets messages should be transferred as text payload (only
valid UTF-8 is allowed).

WriteMode WRITE_MODE_BINARY = `1`

Specifies that WebSockets messages should be transferred as binary payload
(any byte combination is allowed).

enum State:

State STATE_CONNECTING = `0`

Socket has been created. The connection is not yet open.

State STATE_OPEN = `1`

The connection is open and ready to communicate.

State STATE_CLOSING = `2`

The connection is in the process of closing. This means a close request has
been sent to the remote peer but confirmation has not been received.

State STATE_CLOSED = `3`

The connection is closed or couldn't be opened.

## Property Descriptions

PackedStringArray handshake_headers = `PackedStringArray()`

  * void set_handshake_headers(value: PackedStringArray)

  * PackedStringArray get_handshake_headers()

The extra HTTP headers to be sent during the WebSocket handshake.

Note: Not supported in Web exports due to browsers' restrictions.

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedStringArray for more details.

float heartbeat_interval = `0.0`

  * void set_heartbeat_interval(value: float)

  * float get_heartbeat_interval()

The interval (in seconds) at which the peer will automatically send WebSocket
"ping" control frames. When set to `0`, no "ping" control frames will be sent.

Note: Has no effect in Web exports due to browser restrictions.

int inbound_buffer_size = `65535`

  * void set_inbound_buffer_size(value: int)

  * int get_inbound_buffer_size()

The size of the input buffer in bytes (roughly the maximum amount of memory
that will be allocated for the inbound packets).

int max_queued_packets = `4096`

  * void set_max_queued_packets(value: int)

  * int get_max_queued_packets()

The maximum amount of packets that will be allowed in the queues (both inbound
and outbound).

int outbound_buffer_size = `65535`

  * void set_outbound_buffer_size(value: int)

  * int get_outbound_buffer_size()

The size of the input buffer in bytes (roughly the maximum amount of memory
that will be allocated for the outbound packets).

PackedStringArray supported_protocols = `PackedStringArray()`

  * void set_supported_protocols(value: PackedStringArray)

  * PackedStringArray get_supported_protocols()

The WebSocket sub-protocols allowed during the WebSocket handshake.

Note: The returned array is copied and any changes to it will not update the
original property value. See PackedStringArray for more details.

## Method Descriptions

Error accept_stream(stream: StreamPeer)

Accepts a peer connection performing the HTTP handshake as a WebSocket server.
The `stream` must be a valid TCP stream retrieved via
TCPServer.take_connection(), or a TLS stream accepted via
StreamPeerTLS.accept_stream().

Note: Not supported in Web exports due to browsers' restrictions.

void close(code: int = 1000, reason: String = "")

Closes this WebSocket connection. `code` is the status code for the closure
(see RFC 6455 section 7.4 for a list of valid status codes). `reason` is the
human readable reason for closing the connection (can be any UTF-8 string
that's smaller than 123 bytes). If `code` is negative, the connection will be
closed immediately without notifying the remote peer.

Note: To achieve a clean close, you will need to keep polling until
STATE_CLOSED is reached.

Note: The Web export might not support all status codes. Please refer to
browser-specific documentation for more details.

Error connect_to_url(url: String, tls_client_options: TLSOptions = null)

Connects to the given URL. TLS certificates will be verified against the
hostname when connecting using the `wss://` protocol. You can pass the
optional `tls_client_options` parameter to customize the trusted certification
authorities, or disable the common name verification. See TLSOptions.client()
and TLSOptions.client_unsafe().

Note: This method is non-blocking, and will return @GlobalScope.OK before the
connection is established as long as the provided parameters are valid and the
peer is not in an invalid state (e.g. already connected). Regularly call
poll() (e.g. during Node process) and check the result of get_ready_state() to
know whether the connection succeeds or fails.

Note: To avoid mixed content warnings or errors in Web, you may have to use a
`url` that starts with `wss://` (secure) instead of `ws://`. When doing so,
make sure to use the fully qualified domain name that matches the one defined
in the server's TLS certificate. Do not connect directly via the IP address
for `wss://` connections, as it won't match with the TLS certificate.

int get_close_code() const

Returns the received WebSocket close frame status code, or `-1` when the
connection was not cleanly closed. Only call this method when
get_ready_state() returns STATE_CLOSED.

String get_close_reason() const

Returns the received WebSocket close frame status reason string. Only call
this method when get_ready_state() returns STATE_CLOSED.

String get_connected_host() const

Returns the IP address of the connected peer.

Note: Not available in the Web export.

int get_connected_port() const

Returns the remote port of the connected peer.

Note: Not available in the Web export.

int get_current_outbound_buffered_amount() const

Returns the current amount of data in the outbound websocket buffer. Note: Web
exports use WebSocket.bufferedAmount, while other platforms use an internal
buffer.

State get_ready_state() const

Returns the ready state of the connection. See State.

String get_requested_url() const

Returns the URL requested by this peer. The URL is derived from the `url`
passed to connect_to_url() or from the HTTP headers when acting as server
(i.e. when using accept_stream()).

String get_selected_protocol() const

Returns the selected WebSocket sub-protocol for this connection or an empty
string if the sub-protocol has not been selected yet.

void poll()

Updates the connection state and receive incoming packets. Call this function
regularly to keep it in a clean state.

Error send(message: PackedByteArray, write_mode: WriteMode = 1)

Sends the given `message` using the desired `write_mode`. When sending a
String, prefer using send_text().

Error send_text(message: String)

Sends the given `message` using WebSocket text mode. Prefer this method over
PacketPeer.put_packet() when interacting with third-party text-based API (e.g.
when using JSON formatted messages).

void set_no_delay(enabled: bool)

Disable Nagle's algorithm on the underlying TCP socket (default). See
StreamPeerTCP.set_no_delay() for more information.

Note: Not available in the Web export.

bool was_string_packet() const

Returns `true` if the last received packet was sent as a text payload. See
WriteMode.
