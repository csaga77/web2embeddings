TextureParam TEXTURE_ORM = `17`

Texture holding ambient occlusion, roughness, and metallic.

TextureParam TEXTURE_MAX = `18`

Represents the size of the TextureParam enum.

enum TextureFilter:

TextureFilter TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST = `0`

The texture filter reads from the nearest pixel only. This makes the texture
look pixelated from up close, and grainy from a distance (due to mipmaps not
being sampled).

TextureFilter TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR = `1`

The texture filter blends between the nearest 4 pixels. This makes the texture
look smooth from up close, and grainy from a distance (due to mipmaps not
being sampled).

TextureFilter TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST_WITH_MIPMAPS = `2`

The texture filter reads from the nearest pixel and blends between the nearest
2 mipmaps (or uses the nearest mipmap if
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/default_filters/use_nearest_mipmap_filter
is `true`). This makes the texture look pixelated from up close, and smooth
from a distance.

TextureFilter TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_WITH_MIPMAPS = `3`

The texture filter blends between the nearest 4 pixels and between the nearest
2 mipmaps (or uses the nearest mipmap if
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/default_filters/use_nearest_mipmap_filter
is `true`). This makes the texture look smooth from up close, and smooth from
a distance.

TextureFilter TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC = `4`

The texture filter reads from the nearest pixel and blends between 2 mipmaps
(or uses the nearest mipmap if
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/default_filters/use_nearest_mipmap_filter
is `true`) based on the angle between the surface and the camera view. This
makes the texture look pixelated from up close, and smooth from a distance.
Anisotropic filtering improves texture quality on surfaces that are almost in
line with the camera, but is slightly slower. The anisotropic filtering level
can be changed by adjusting
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/default_filters/anisotropic_filtering_level.

TextureFilter TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC = `5`

The texture filter blends between the nearest 4 pixels and blends between 2
mipmaps (or uses the nearest mipmap if
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/default_filters/use_nearest_mipmap_filter
is `true`) based on the angle between the surface and the camera view. This
makes the texture look smooth from up close, and smooth from a distance.
Anisotropic filtering improves texture quality on surfaces that are almost in
line with the camera, but is slightly slower. The anisotropic filtering level
can be changed by adjusting
ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/default_filters/anisotropic_filtering_level.

TextureFilter TEXTURE_FILTER_MAX = `6`

Represents the size of the TextureFilter enum.

enum DetailUV:

DetailUV DETAIL_UV_1 = `0`

Use `UV` with the detail texture.

DetailUV DETAIL_UV_2 = `1`

Use `UV2` with the detail texture.

enum Transparency:

Transparency TRANSPARENCY_DISABLED = `0`

The material will not use transparency. This is the fastest to render.

Transparency TRANSPARENCY_ALPHA = `1`

The material will use the texture's alpha values for transparency. This is the
slowest to render, and disables shadow casting.

Transparency TRANSPARENCY_ALPHA_SCISSOR = `2`

The material will cut off all values below a threshold, the rest will remain
opaque. The opaque portions will be rendered in the depth prepass. This is
faster to render than alpha blending, but slower than opaque rendering. This
also supports casting shadows.

Transparency TRANSPARENCY_ALPHA_HASH = `3`

The material will cut off all values below a spatially-deterministic
threshold, the rest will remain opaque. This is faster to render than alpha
blending, but slower than opaque rendering. This also supports casting
shadows. Alpha hashing is suited for hair rendering.

Transparency TRANSPARENCY_ALPHA_DEPTH_PRE_PASS = `4`

The material will use the texture's alpha value for transparency, but will
discard fragments with an alpha of less than 0.99 during the depth prepass and
fragments with an alpha less than 0.1 during the shadow pass. This also
supports casting shadows.

Transparency TRANSPARENCY_MAX = `5`

Represents the size of the Transparency enum.

enum ShadingMode:

ShadingMode SHADING_MODE_UNSHADED = `0`

The object will not receive shadows. This is the fastest to render, but it
disables all interactions with lights.

ShadingMode SHADING_MODE_PER_PIXEL = `1`

The object will be shaded per pixel. Useful for realistic shading effects.

ShadingMode SHADING_MODE_PER_VERTEX = `2`

The object will be shaded per vertex. Useful when you want cheaper shaders and
do not care about visual quality.

ShadingMode SHADING_MODE_MAX = `3`

Represents the size of the ShadingMode enum.

enum Feature:

Feature FEATURE_EMISSION = `0`

Constant for setting emission_enabled.

Feature FEATURE_NORMAL_MAPPING = `1`

Constant for setting normal_enabled.

Feature FEATURE_RIM = `2`

Constant for setting rim_enabled.

Feature FEATURE_CLEARCOAT = `3`

Constant for setting clearcoat_enabled.

Feature FEATURE_ANISOTROPY = `4`

Constant for setting anisotropy_enabled.

Feature FEATURE_AMBIENT_OCCLUSION = `5`

Constant for setting ao_enabled.

Feature FEATURE_HEIGHT_MAPPING = `6`

Constant for setting heightmap_enabled.

Feature FEATURE_SUBSURFACE_SCATTERING = `7`

Constant for setting subsurf_scatter_enabled.

Feature FEATURE_SUBSURFACE_TRANSMITTANCE = `8`

Constant for setting subsurf_scatter_transmittance_enabled.

Feature FEATURE_BACKLIGHT = `9`

Constant for setting backlight_enabled.

Feature FEATURE_REFRACTION = `10`

Constant for setting refraction_enabled.

Feature FEATURE_DETAIL = `11`

Constant for setting detail_enabled.

Feature FEATURE_MAX = `12`

Represents the size of the Feature enum.

enum BlendMode:

BlendMode BLEND_MODE_MIX = `0`

Default blend mode. The color of the object is blended over the background
based on the object's alpha value.

BlendMode BLEND_MODE_ADD = `1`

The color of the object is added to the background.

BlendMode BLEND_MODE_SUB = `2`

The color of the object is subtracted from the background.

BlendMode BLEND_MODE_MUL = `3`

The color of the object is multiplied by the background.

BlendMode BLEND_MODE_PREMULT_ALPHA = `4`

The color of the object is added to the background and the alpha channel is
used to mask out the background. This is effectively a hybrid of the blend mix
and add modes, useful for effects like fire where you want the flame to add
but the smoke to mix. By default, this works with unshaded materials using
premultiplied textures. For shaded materials, use the `PREMUL_ALPHA_FACTOR`
built-in so that lighting can be modulated as well.

enum AlphaAntiAliasing:

AlphaAntiAliasing ALPHA_ANTIALIASING_OFF = `0`

Disables Alpha AntiAliasing for the material.

AlphaAntiAliasing ALPHA_ANTIALIASING_ALPHA_TO_COVERAGE = `1`

Enables AlphaToCoverage. Alpha values in the material are passed to the
AntiAliasing sample mask.

AlphaAntiAliasing ALPHA_ANTIALIASING_ALPHA_TO_COVERAGE_AND_TO_ONE = `2`

Enables AlphaToCoverage and forces all non-zero alpha values to `1`. Alpha
values in the material are passed to the AntiAliasing sample mask.

enum DepthDrawMode:

DepthDrawMode DEPTH_DRAW_OPAQUE_ONLY = `0`

Default depth draw mode. Depth is drawn only for opaque objects during the
opaque prepass (if any) and during the opaque pass.

DepthDrawMode DEPTH_DRAW_ALWAYS = `1`

Objects will write to depth during the opaque and the transparent passes.
Transparent objects that are close to the camera may obscure other transparent
objects behind them.

Note: This does not influence whether transparent objects are included in the
depth prepass or not. For that, see Transparency.

DepthDrawMode DEPTH_DRAW_DISABLED = `2`

Objects will not write their depth to the depth buffer, even during the depth
prepass (if enabled).

enum CullMode:

CullMode CULL_BACK = `0`

Default cull mode. The back of the object is culled when not visible. Back
face triangles will be culled when facing the camera. This results in only the
front side of triangles being drawn. For closed-surface meshes, this means
that only the exterior of the mesh will be visible.

CullMode CULL_FRONT = `1`

Front face triangles will be culled when facing the camera. This results in
only the back side of triangles being drawn. For closed-surface meshes, this
means that the interior of the mesh will be drawn instead of the exterior.

CullMode CULL_DISABLED = `2`

No face culling is performed; both the front face and back face will be
visible.

enum Flags:

Flags FLAG_DISABLE_DEPTH_TEST = `0`

Disables the depth test, so this object is drawn on top of all others drawn
before it. This puts the object in the transparent draw pass where it is
sorted based on distance to camera. Objects drawn after it in the draw order
may cover it. This also disables writing to depth.

Flags FLAG_ALBEDO_FROM_VERTEX_COLOR = `1`

Set `ALBEDO` to the per-vertex color specified in the mesh.

Flags FLAG_SRGB_VERTEX_COLOR = `2`

Vertex colors are considered to be stored in sRGB color space and are
converted to linear color space during rendering. See also
vertex_color_is_srgb.

Note: Only effective when using the Forward+ and Mobile rendering methods.

Flags FLAG_USE_POINT_SIZE = `3`

Uses point size to alter the size of primitive points. Also changes the albedo
texture lookup to use `POINT_COORD` instead of `UV`.

Flags FLAG_FIXED_SIZE = `4`

Object is scaled by depth so that it always appears the same size on screen.

Flags FLAG_BILLBOARD_KEEP_SCALE = `5`

Shader will keep the scale set for the mesh. Otherwise the scale is lost when
billboarding. Only applies when billboard_mode is BILLBOARD_ENABLED.

Flags FLAG_UV1_USE_TRIPLANAR = `6`

Use triplanar texture lookup for all texture lookups that would normally use
`UV`.

Flags FLAG_UV2_USE_TRIPLANAR = `7`

Use triplanar texture lookup for all texture lookups that would normally use
`UV2`.

Flags FLAG_UV1_USE_WORLD_TRIPLANAR = `8`

Use triplanar texture lookup for all texture lookups that would normally use
`UV`.

Flags FLAG_UV2_USE_WORLD_TRIPLANAR = `9`

Use triplanar texture lookup for all texture lookups that would normally use
`UV2`.

Flags FLAG_AO_ON_UV2 = `10`

Use `UV2` coordinates to look up from the ao_texture.

Flags FLAG_EMISSION_ON_UV2 = `11`

Use `UV2` coordinates to look up from the emission_texture.

Flags FLAG_ALBEDO_TEXTURE_FORCE_SRGB = `12`

Forces the shader to convert albedo from sRGB space to linear space. See also
albedo_texture_force_srgb.

Flags FLAG_DONT_RECEIVE_SHADOWS = `13`

Disables receiving shadows from other objects.

Flags FLAG_DISABLE_AMBIENT_LIGHT = `14`

Disables receiving ambient light.

Flags FLAG_USE_SHADOW_TO_OPACITY = `15`

Enables the shadow to opacity feature.

Flags FLAG_USE_TEXTURE_REPEAT = `16`

Enables the texture to repeat when UV coordinates are outside the 0-1 range.
If using one of the linear filtering modes, this can result in artifacts at
the edges of a texture when the sampler filters across the edges of the
texture.

Flags FLAG_INVERT_HEIGHTMAP = `17`

Invert values read from a depth texture to convert them to height values
(heightmap).

Flags FLAG_SUBSURFACE_MODE_SKIN = `18`

Enables the skin mode for subsurface scattering which is used to improve the
look of subsurface scattering when used for human skin.

Flags FLAG_PARTICLE_TRAILS_MODE = `19`

Enables parts of the shader required for GPUParticles3D trails to function.
This also requires using a mesh with appropriate skinning, such as
RibbonTrailMesh or TubeTrailMesh. Enabling this feature outside of materials
used in GPUParticles3D meshes will break material rendering.

Flags FLAG_ALBEDO_TEXTURE_MSDF = `20`

Enables multichannel signed distance field rendering shader.

Flags FLAG_DISABLE_FOG = `21`

Disables receiving depth-based or volumetric fog.

Flags FLAG_MAX = `22`

Represents the size of the Flags enum.

enum DiffuseMode:

DiffuseMode DIFFUSE_BURLEY = `0`

Default diffuse scattering algorithm.

DiffuseMode DIFFUSE_LAMBERT = `1`

Extends Lambert to cover more than 90 degrees when roughness increases.

DiffuseMode DIFFUSE_TOON = `3`

Uses a hard cut for lighting, with smoothing affected by roughness.

enum SpecularMode:

SpecularMode SPECULAR_SCHLICK_GGX = `0`

Default specular blob.

SpecularMode SPECULAR_TOON = `1`

Toon blob which changes size based on roughness.

SpecularMode SPECULAR_DISABLED = `2`

No specular blob. This is slightly faster to render than other specular modes.

enum BillboardMode:

BillboardMode BILLBOARD_DISABLED = `0`

Billboard mode is disabled.

BillboardMode BILLBOARD_ENABLED = `1`

The object's Z axis will always face the camera.

BillboardMode BILLBOARD_FIXED_Y = `2`

The object's X axis will always face the camera.

BillboardMode BILLBOARD_PARTICLES = `3`

Used for particle systems when assigned to GPUParticles3D and CPUParticles3D
nodes (flipbook animation). Enables `particles_anim_*` properties.

The ParticleProcessMaterial.anim_speed_min or CPUParticles3D.anim_speed_min
should also be set to a value bigger than zero for the animation to play.

enum TextureChannel:

TextureChannel TEXTURE_CHANNEL_RED = `0`

Used to read from the red channel of a texture.

TextureChannel TEXTURE_CHANNEL_GREEN = `1`

Used to read from the green channel of a texture.

TextureChannel TEXTURE_CHANNEL_BLUE = `2`

Used to read from the blue channel of a texture.

TextureChannel TEXTURE_CHANNEL_ALPHA = `3`

Used to read from the alpha channel of a texture.

TextureChannel TEXTURE_CHANNEL_GRAYSCALE = `4`

Used to read from the linear (non-perceptual) average of the red, green and
blue channels of a texture.

enum EmissionOperator:

EmissionOperator EMISSION_OP_ADD = `0`

Adds the emission color to the color from the emission texture.

EmissionOperator EMISSION_OP_MULTIPLY = `1`

Multiplies the emission color by the color from the emission texture.

using the alpha channel.

DistanceFadeMode DISTANCE_FADE_PIXEL_DITHER = `2`

Smoothly fades the object out based on each pixel's distance from the camera
using a dithering approach. Dithering discards pixels based on a set pattern
to smoothly fade without enabling transparency. On certain hardware, this can
be faster than DISTANCE_FADE_PIXEL_ALPHA.

DistanceFadeMode DISTANCE_FADE_OBJECT_DITHER = `3`

Smoothly fades the object out based on the object's distance from the camera
using a dithering approach. Dithering discards pixels based on a set pattern
to smoothly fade without enabling transparency. On certain hardware, this can
be faster than DISTANCE_FADE_PIXEL_ALPHA and DISTANCE_FADE_PIXEL_DITHER.

## Property Descriptions

Color albedo_color = `Color(1, 1, 1, 1)`

  * void set_albedo(value: Color)

  * Color get_albedo()

The material's base color.

Note: If detail_enabled is `true` and a detail_albedo texture is specified,
albedo_color will not modulate the detail texture. This can be used to color
partial areas of a material by not specifying an albedo texture and using a
transparent detail_albedo texture instead.

Texture2D albedo_texture

  * void set_texture(param: TextureParam, texture: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture(param: TextureParam) const

Texture to multiply by albedo_color. Used for basic texturing of objects.

If the texture appears unexpectedly too dark or too bright, check
albedo_texture_force_srgb.

bool albedo_texture_force_srgb = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, forces a conversion of the albedo_texture from sRGB color space to
linear color space. See also vertex_color_is_srgb.

This should only be enabled when needed (typically when using a
ViewportTexture as albedo_texture). If albedo_texture_force_srgb is `true`
when it shouldn't be, the texture will appear to be too dark. If
albedo_texture_force_srgb is `false` when it shouldn't be, the texture will
appear to be too bright.

bool albedo_texture_msdf = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

Enables multichannel signed distance field rendering shader. Use
msdf_pixel_range and msdf_outline_size to configure MSDF parameters.

float alpha_antialiasing_edge

  * void set_alpha_antialiasing_edge(value: float)

  * float get_alpha_antialiasing_edge()

Threshold at which antialiasing will be applied on the alpha channel.

AlphaAntiAliasing alpha_antialiasing_mode

  * void set_alpha_antialiasing(value: AlphaAntiAliasing)

  * AlphaAntiAliasing get_alpha_antialiasing()

The type of alpha antialiasing to apply. See AlphaAntiAliasing.

float alpha_hash_scale

  * void set_alpha_hash_scale(value: float)

  * float get_alpha_hash_scale()

The hashing scale for Alpha Hash. Recommended values between `0` and `2`.

float alpha_scissor_threshold

  * void set_alpha_scissor_threshold(value: float)

  * float get_alpha_scissor_threshold()

Threshold at which the alpha scissor will discard values. Higher values will
result in more pixels being discarded. If the material becomes too opaque at a
distance, try increasing alpha_scissor_threshold. If the material disappears
at a distance, try decreasing alpha_scissor_threshold.

float anisotropy = `0.0`

  * void set_anisotropy(value: float)

  * float get_anisotropy()

The strength of the anisotropy effect. This is multiplied by
anisotropy_flowmap's alpha channel if a texture is defined there and the
texture contains an alpha channel.

bool anisotropy_enabled = `false`

  * void set_feature(feature: Feature, enable: bool)

  * bool get_feature(feature: Feature) const

If `true`, anisotropy is enabled. Anisotropy changes the shape of the specular
blob and aligns it to tangent space. This is useful for brushed aluminum and
hair reflections.

Note: Mesh tangents are needed for anisotropy to work. If the mesh does not
contain tangents, the anisotropy effect will appear broken.

Note: Material anisotropy should not to be confused with anisotropic texture
filtering, which can be enabled by setting texture_filter to
TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC.

Texture2D anisotropy_flowmap

  * void set_texture(param: TextureParam, texture: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture(param: TextureParam) const

Texture that offsets the tangent map for anisotropy calculations and
optionally controls the anisotropy effect (if an alpha channel is present).
The flowmap texture is expected to be a derivative map, with the red channel
representing distortion on the X axis and green channel representing
distortion on the Y axis. Values below 0.5 will result in negative distortion,
whereas values above 0.5 will result in positive distortion.

If present, the texture's alpha channel will be used to multiply the strength
of the anisotropy effect. Fully opaque pixels will keep the anisotropy
effect's original strength while fully transparent pixels will disable the
anisotropy effect entirely. The flowmap texture's blue channel is ignored.

bool ao_enabled = `false`

  * void set_feature(feature: Feature, enable: bool)

  * bool get_feature(feature: Feature) const

If `true`, ambient occlusion is enabled. Ambient occlusion darkens areas based
on the ao_texture.

float ao_light_affect = `0.0`

  * void set_ao_light_affect(value: float)

  * float get_ao_light_affect()

Amount that ambient occlusion affects lighting from lights. If `0`, ambient
occlusion only affects ambient light. If `1`, ambient occlusion affects lights
just as much as it affects ambient light. This can be used to impact the
strength of the ambient occlusion effect, but typically looks unrealistic.

bool ao_on_uv2 = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, use `UV2` coordinates to look up from the ao_texture.

Texture2D ao_texture

  * void set_texture(param: TextureParam, texture: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture(param: TextureParam) const

Texture that defines the amount of ambient occlusion for a given point on the
object.

TextureChannel ao_texture_channel = `0`

  * void set_ao_texture_channel(value: TextureChannel)

  * TextureChannel get_ao_texture_channel()

Specifies the channel of the ao_texture in which the ambient occlusion
information is stored. This is useful when you store the information for
multiple effects in a single texture. For example if you stored metallic in
the red channel, roughness in the blue, and ambient occlusion in the green you
could reduce the number of textures you use.

Texture used to control the backlight effect per-pixel. Added to backlight.

bool billboard_keep_scale = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

scale is lost when billboarding. Only applies when billboard_mode is not
BILLBOARD_DISABLED.

BillboardMode billboard_mode = `0`

  * void set_billboard_mode(value: BillboardMode)

  * BillboardMode get_billboard_mode()

Controls how the object faces the camera. See BillboardMode.

Note: Billboard mode is not suitable for VR because the left-right vector of
the camera is not horizontal when the screen is attached to your head instead
of on the table. See GitHub issue #41567 for details.

BlendMode blend_mode = `0`

  * void set_blend_mode(value: BlendMode)

  * BlendMode get_blend_mode()

The material's blend mode.

Note: Values other than `Mix` force the object into the transparent pipeline.
See BlendMode.

float clearcoat = `1.0`

  * void set_clearcoat(value: float)

  * float get_clearcoat()

Sets the strength of the clearcoat effect. Setting to `0` looks the same as
disabling the clearcoat effect.

bool clearcoat_enabled = `false`

  * void set_feature(feature: Feature, enable: bool)

  * bool get_feature(feature: Feature) const

If `true`, clearcoat rendering is enabled. Adds a secondary transparent pass
to the lighting calculation resulting in an added specular blob. This makes
materials appear as if they have a clear layer on them that can be either
glossy or rough.

Note: Clearcoat rendering is not visible if the material's shading_mode is
SHADING_MODE_UNSHADED.

float clearcoat_roughness = `0.5`

  * void set_clearcoat_roughness(value: float)

  * float get_clearcoat_roughness()

Sets the roughness of the clearcoat pass. A higher value results in a rougher
clearcoat while a lower value results in a smoother clearcoat.

Texture2D clearcoat_texture

  * void set_texture(param: TextureParam, texture: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture(param: TextureParam) const

Texture that defines the strength of the clearcoat effect and the glossiness
of the clearcoat. Strength is specified in the red channel while glossiness is
specified in the green channel.

CullMode cull_mode = `0`

  * void set_cull_mode(value: CullMode)

  * CullMode get_cull_mode()

Determines which side of the triangle to cull depending on whether the
triangle faces towards or away from the camera. See CullMode.

DepthDrawMode depth_draw_mode = `0`

  * void set_depth_draw_mode(value: DepthDrawMode)

  * DepthDrawMode get_depth_draw_mode()

Determines when depth rendering takes place. See DepthDrawMode. See also
transparency.

Texture2D detail_albedo

  * void set_texture(param: TextureParam, texture: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture(param: TextureParam) const

Texture that specifies the color of the detail overlay. detail_albedo's alpha
channel is used as a mask, even when the material is opaque. To use a
dedicated texture as a mask, see detail_mask.

Note: detail_albedo is not modulated by albedo_color.

BlendMode detail_blend_mode = `0`

  * void set_detail_blend_mode(value: BlendMode)

  * BlendMode get_detail_blend_mode()

Specifies how the detail_albedo should blend with the current `ALBEDO`. See
BlendMode for options.

bool detail_enabled = `false`

  * void set_feature(feature: Feature, enable: bool)

  * bool get_feature(feature: Feature) const

If `true`, enables the detail overlay. Detail is a second texture that gets
mixed over the surface of the object based on detail_mask and detail_albedo's
alpha channel. This can be used to add variation to objects, or to blend
between two different albedo/normal textures.

Texture2D detail_mask

  * void set_texture(param: TextureParam, texture: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture(param: TextureParam) const

Texture used to specify how the detail textures get blended with the base
textures. detail_mask can be used together with detail_albedo's alpha channel
(if any).

Texture2D detail_normal

  * void set_texture(param: TextureParam, texture: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture(param: TextureParam) const

Texture that specifies the per-pixel normal of the detail overlay. The
detail_normal texture only uses the red and green channels; the blue and alpha
channels are ignored. The normal read from detail_normal is oriented around
the surface normal provided by the Mesh.

Note: Godot expects the normal map to use X+, Y+, and Z+ coordinates. See this
page for a comparison of normal map coordinates expected by popular engines.

DetailUV detail_uv_layer = `0`

  * void set_detail_uv(value: DetailUV)

  * DetailUV get_detail_uv()

Specifies whether to use `UV` or `UV2` for the detail layer. See DetailUV for
options.

DiffuseMode diffuse_mode = `0`

  * void set_diffuse_mode(value: DiffuseMode)

The algorithm used for diffuse light scattering. See DiffuseMode.

bool disable_ambient_light = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, the object receives no ambient light.

bool disable_fog = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, the object will not be affected by fog (neither volumetric nor
depth fog). This is useful for unshaded or transparent materials (e.g.
particles), which without this setting will be affected even if fully
transparent.

bool disable_receive_shadows = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, the object receives no shadow that would otherwise be cast onto it.

float distance_fade_max_distance = `10.0`

  * void set_distance_fade_max_distance(value: float)

  * float get_distance_fade_max_distance()

Distance at which the object appears fully opaque.

Note: If distance_fade_max_distance is less than distance_fade_min_distance,
the behavior will be reversed. The object will start to fade away at
distance_fade_max_distance and will fully disappear once it reaches
distance_fade_min_distance.

float distance_fade_min_distance = `0.0`

  * void set_distance_fade_min_distance(value: float)

  * float get_distance_fade_min_distance()

Distance at which the object starts to become visible. If the object is less
than this distance away, it will be invisible.

Note: If distance_fade_min_distance is greater than
distance_fade_max_distance, the behavior will be reversed. The object will
start to fade away at distance_fade_max_distance and will fully disappear once
it reaches distance_fade_min_distance.

DistanceFadeMode distance_fade_mode = `0`

  * void set_distance_fade(value: DistanceFadeMode)

  * DistanceFadeMode get_distance_fade()

Specifies which type of fade to use. Can be any of the DistanceFadeModes.

Color emission = `Color(0, 0, 0, 1)`

  * void set_emission(value: Color)

  * Color get_emission()

The emitted light's color. See emission_enabled.

bool emission_enabled = `false`

  * void set_feature(feature: Feature, enable: bool)

  * bool get_feature(feature: Feature) const

If `true`, the body emits light. Emitting light makes the object appear
brighter. The object can also cast light on other objects if a VoxelGI, SDFGI,
or LightmapGI is used and this object is used in baked lighting.

float emission_energy_multiplier = `1.0`

  * void set_emission_energy_multiplier(value: float)

  * float get_emission_energy_multiplier()

Multiplier for emitted light. See emission_enabled.

float emission_intensity

  * void set_emission_intensity(value: float)

  * float get_emission_intensity()

Luminance of emitted light, measured in nits (candela per square meter). Only
available when
ProjectSettings.rendering/lights_and_shadows/use_physical_light_units is
enabled. The default is roughly equivalent to an indoor lightbulb.

bool emission_on_uv2 = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

Use `UV2` to read from the emission_texture.

EmissionOperator emission_operator = `0`

  * void set_emission_operator(value: EmissionOperator)

Sets how emission interacts with emission_texture. Can either add or multiply.
See EmissionOperator for options.

Texture2D emission_texture

  * Texture2D get_texture(param: TextureParam) const

Texture that specifies how much surface emits light at a given point.

bool fixed_size = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, the object is rendered at the same size regardless of distance.

bool grow = `false`

  * void set_grow_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_grow_enabled()

If `true`, enables the vertex grow setting. This can be used to create mesh-
based outlines using a second material pass and its cull_mode set to
CULL_FRONT. See also grow_amount.

Note: Vertex growth cannot create new vertices, which means that visible gaps
may occur in sharp corners. This can be alleviated by designing the mesh to
use smooth normals exclusively using face weighted normals in the 3D authoring
software. In this case, grow will be able to join every outline together, just
like in the original mesh.

float grow_amount = `0.0`

  * void set_grow(value: float)

  * float get_grow()

Grows object vertices in the direction of their normals. Only effective if
grow is `true`.

bool heightmap_deep_parallax = `false`

  * void set_heightmap_deep_parallax(value: bool)

  * bool is_heightmap_deep_parallax_enabled()

If `true`, uses parallax occlusion mapping to represent depth in the material
instead of simple offset mapping (see heightmap_enabled). This results in a
more convincing depth effect, but is much more expensive on the GPU. Only
enable this on materials where it makes a significant visual difference.

bool heightmap_enabled = `false`

  * void set_feature(feature: Feature, enable: bool)

  * bool get_feature(feature: Feature) const

If `true`, height mapping is enabled (also called "parallax mapping" or "depth
mapping"). See also normal_enabled. Height mapping is a demanding feature on
the GPU, so it should only be used on materials where it makes a significant
visual difference.

Note: Height mapping is not supported if triplanar mapping is used on the same
material. The value of heightmap_enabled will be ignored if uv1_triplanar is
enabled.

bool heightmap_flip_binormal = `false`

  * void set_heightmap_deep_parallax_flip_binormal(value: bool)

  * bool get_heightmap_deep_parallax_flip_binormal()

If `true`, flips the mesh's binormal vectors when interpreting the height map.
If the heightmap effect looks strange when the camera moves (even with a
reasonable heightmap_scale), try setting this to `true`.

bool heightmap_flip_tangent = `false`

  * void set_heightmap_deep_parallax_flip_tangent(value: bool)

  * bool get_heightmap_deep_parallax_flip_tangent()

If `true`, flips the mesh's tangent vectors when interpreting the height map.
If the heightmap effect looks strange when the camera moves (even with a
reasonable heightmap_scale), try setting this to `true`.

bool heightmap_flip_texture = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, interprets the height map texture as a depth map, with brighter
values appearing to be "lower" in altitude compared to darker values.

This can be enabled for compatibility with some materials authored for Godot
3.x. This is not necessary if the Invert import option was used to invert the
depth map in Godot 3.x, in which case heightmap_flip_texture should remain
`false`.

int heightmap_max_layers

  * void set_heightmap_deep_parallax_max_layers(value: int)

  * int get_heightmap_deep_parallax_max_layers()

The number of layers to use for parallax occlusion mapping when the camera is
up close to the material. Higher values result in a more convincing depth
effect, especially in materials that have steep height changes. Higher values
have a significant cost on the GPU, so it should only be increased on
materials where it makes a significant visual difference.

Note: Only effective if heightmap_deep_parallax is `true`.

int heightmap_min_layers

  * void set_heightmap_deep_parallax_min_layers(value: int)

  * int get_heightmap_deep_parallax_min_layers()

The number of layers to use for parallax occlusion mapping when the camera is
far away from the material. Higher values result in a more convincing depth
effect, especially in materials that have steep height changes. Higher values
have a significant cost on the GPU, so it should only be increased on
materials where it makes a significant visual difference.

Note: Only effective if heightmap_deep_parallax is `true`.

float heightmap_scale = `5.0`

  * void set_heightmap_scale(value: float)

  * float get_heightmap_scale()

The heightmap scale to use for the parallax effect (see heightmap_enabled).
The default value is tuned so that the highest point (value = 255) appears to
be 5 cm higher than the lowest point (value = 0). Higher values result in a
deeper appearance, but may result in artifacts appearing when looking at the
material from oblique angles, especially when the camera moves. Negative
values can be used to invert the parallax effect, but this is different from
inverting the texture using heightmap_flip_texture as the material will also
appear to be "closer" to the camera. In most cases, heightmap_scale should be
kept to a positive value.

Note: If the height map effect looks strange regardless of this value, try
adjusting heightmap_flip_binormal and heightmap_flip_tangent. See also
heightmap_texture for recommendations on authoring heightmap textures, as the
way the heightmap texture is authored affects how heightmap_scale behaves.

Texture2D heightmap_texture

  * void set_texture(param: TextureParam, texture: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture(param: TextureParam) const

The texture to use as a height map. See also heightmap_enabled.

For best results, the texture should be normalized (with heightmap_scale
reduced to compensate). In GIMP, this can be done using Colors > Auto >
Equalize. If the texture only uses a small part of its available range, the
parallax effect may look strange, especially when the camera moves.

Note: To reduce memory usage and improve loading times, you may be able to use
a lower-resolution heightmap texture as most heightmaps are only comprised of
low-frequency data.

float metallic = `0.0`

  * void set_metallic(value: float)

  * float get_metallic()

A high value makes the material appear more like a metal. Non-metals use their
albedo as the diffuse color and add diffuse to the specular reflection. With
non-metals, the reflection appears on top of the albedo color. Metals use
their albedo as a multiplier to the specular reflection and set the diffuse
color to black resulting in a tinted reflection. Materials work better when
fully metal or fully non-metal, values between `0` and `1` should only be used
for blending between metal and non-metal sections. To alter the amount of
reflection use roughness.

float metallic_specular = `0.5`

  * void set_specular(value: float)

  * float get_specular()

Adjusts the strength of specular reflections. Specular reflections are
composed of scene reflections and the specular lobe which is the bright spot
that is reflected from light sources. When set to `0.0`, no specular
reflections will be visible. This differs from the SPECULAR_DISABLED
SpecularMode as SPECULAR_DISABLED only applies to the specular lobe from the
light source.

Note: Unlike metallic, this is not energy-conserving, so it should be left at
`0.5` in most cases. See also roughness.

Texture2D metallic_texture

  * void set_texture(param: TextureParam, texture: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture(param: TextureParam) const

Texture used to specify metallic for an object. This is multiplied by
metallic.

TextureChannel metallic_texture_channel = `0`

  * void set_metallic_texture_channel(value: TextureChannel)

  * TextureChannel get_metallic_texture_channel()

Specifies the channel of the metallic_texture in which the metallic
information is stored. This is useful when you store the information for
multiple effects in a single texture. For example if you stored metallic in
the red channel, roughness in the blue, and ambient occlusion in the green you
could reduce the number of textures you use.

float msdf_outline_size = `0.0`

  * void set_msdf_outline_size(value: float)

  * float get_msdf_outline_size()

The width of the shape outline.

float msdf_pixel_range = `4.0`

  * void set_msdf_pixel_range(value: float)

  * float get_msdf_pixel_range()

The width of the range around the shape between the minimum and maximum
representable signed distance.

bool no_depth_test = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, depth testing is disabled and the object will be drawn in render
order.

bool normal_enabled = `false`

  * void set_feature(feature: Feature, enable: bool)

  * bool get_feature(feature: Feature) const

If `true`, normal mapping is enabled. This has a slight performance cost,
especially on mobile GPUs.

float normal_scale = `1.0`

  * void set_normal_scale(value: float)

  * float get_normal_scale()

The strength of the normal map's effect.

Texture2D normal_texture

  * void set_texture(param: TextureParam, texture: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture(param: TextureParam) const

Texture used to specify the normal at a given pixel. The normal_texture only
uses the red and green channels; the blue and alpha channels are ignored. The
normal read from normal_texture is oriented around the surface normal provided
by the Mesh.

Note: The mesh must have both normals and tangents defined in its vertex data.
Otherwise, the normal map won't render correctly and will only appear to
darken the whole surface. If creating geometry with SurfaceTool, you can use
SurfaceTool.generate_normals() and SurfaceTool.generate_tangents() to
automatically generate normals and tangents respectively.

Note: Godot expects the normal map to use X+, Y+, and Z+ coordinates. See this
page for a comparison of normal map coordinates expected by popular engines.

Note: If detail_enabled is `true`, the detail_albedo texture is drawn below
the normal_texture. To display a normal map above the detail_albedo texture,
use detail_normal instead.

Texture2D orm_texture

  * void set_texture(param: TextureParam, texture: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture(param: TextureParam) const

The Occlusion/Roughness/Metallic texture to use. This is a more efficient
replacement of ao_texture, roughness_texture and metallic_texture in
ORMMaterial3D. Ambient occlusion is stored in the red channel. Roughness map
is stored in the green channel. Metallic map is stored in the blue channel.
The alpha channel is ignored.

longer it takes for an object to fade.

bool proximity_fade_enabled = `false`

  * void set_proximity_fade_enabled(value: bool)

  * bool is_proximity_fade_enabled()

If `true`, the proximity fade effect is enabled. The proximity fade effect
fades out each pixel based on its distance to another object.

bool refraction_enabled = `false`

  * void set_feature(feature: Feature, enable: bool)

  * bool get_feature(feature: Feature) const

If `true`, the refraction effect is enabled. Distorts transparency based on
light from behind the object.

Note: Refraction is implemented using the screen texture. Only opaque
materials will appear in the refraction, since transparent materials do not
appear in the screen texture.

float refraction_scale = `0.05`

  * void set_refraction(value: float)

  * float get_refraction()

The strength of the refraction effect.

Texture2D refraction_texture

refraction_scale.

TextureChannel refraction_texture_channel = `0`

  * void set_refraction_texture_channel(value: TextureChannel)

  * TextureChannel get_refraction_texture_channel()

Specifies the channel of the refraction_texture in which the refraction
information is stored. This is useful when you store the information for
multiple effects in a single texture. For example if you stored refraction in
the red channel, roughness in the blue, and ambient occlusion in the green you
could reduce the number of textures you use.

float rim = `1.0`

  * void set_rim(value: float)

  * float get_rim()

Sets the strength of the rim lighting effect.

bool rim_enabled = `false`

  * void set_feature(feature: Feature, enable: bool)

  * bool get_feature(feature: Feature) const

If `true`, rim effect is enabled. Rim lighting increases the brightness at
glancing angles on an object.

Note: Rim lighting is not visible if the material's shading_mode is
SHADING_MODE_UNSHADED.

Texture2D rim_texture

  * void set_texture(param: TextureParam, texture: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture(param: TextureParam) const

Texture used to set the strength of the rim lighting effect per-pixel.
Multiplied by rim.

float rim_tint = `0.5`

  * void set_rim_tint(value: float)

  * float get_rim_tint()

The amount of to blend light and albedo color when rendering rim effect. If
`0` the light color is used, while `1` means albedo color is used. An
intermediate value generally works best.

float roughness = `1.0`

  * void set_roughness(value: float)

  * float get_roughness()

Surface reflection. A value of `0` represents a perfect mirror while a value
of `1` completely blurs the reflection. See also metallic.

TextureChannel roughness_texture_channel = `0`

  * void set_roughness_texture_channel(value: TextureChannel)

  * TextureChannel get_roughness_texture_channel()

Specifies the channel of the roughness_texture in which the roughness
information is stored. This is useful when you store the information for
multiple effects in a single texture. For example if you stored metallic in
the red channel, roughness in the blue, and ambient occlusion in the green you
could reduce the number of textures you use.

ShadingMode shading_mode = `1`

  * void set_shading_mode(value: ShadingMode)

  * ShadingMode get_shading_mode()

Sets whether the shading takes place, per-pixel, per-vertex or unshaded. Per-
vertex lighting is faster, making it the best choice for mobile applications,
however it looks considerably worse than per-pixel. Unshaded rendering is the
fastest, but disables all interactions with lights.

bool shadow_to_opacity = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, enables the "shadow to opacity" render mode where lighting modifies
the alpha so shadowed areas are opaque and non-shadowed areas are transparent.
Useful for overlaying shadows onto a camera feed in AR.

SpecularMode specular_mode = `0`

  * void set_specular_mode(value: SpecularMode)

  * SpecularMode get_specular_mode()

The method for rendering the specular blob. See SpecularMode.

Note: specular_mode only applies to the specular blob. It does not affect
specular reflections from the sky, screen-space reflections, VoxelGI, SDFGI or
ReflectionProbes. To disable reflections from these sources as well, set
metallic_specular to `0.0` instead.

bool subsurf_scatter_enabled = `false`

  * void set_feature(feature: Feature, enable: bool)

  * bool get_feature(feature: Feature) const

If `true`, subsurface scattering is enabled. Emulates light that penetrates an
object's surface, is scattered, and then emerges. Subsurface scattering
quality is controlled by
ProjectSettings.rendering/environment/subsurface_scattering/subsurface_scattering_quality.

bool subsurf_scatter_skin_mode = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, subsurface scattering will use a special mode optimized for the
color and density of human skin, such as boosting the intensity of the red
channel in subsurface scattering.

float subsurf_scatter_strength = `0.0`

  * void set_subsurface_scattering_strength(value: float)

  * float get_subsurface_scattering_strength()

The strength of the subsurface scattering effect. The depth of the effect is
also controlled by
ProjectSettings.rendering/environment/subsurface_scattering/subsurface_scattering_scale,
which is set globally.

  * bool get_feature(feature: Feature) const

If `true`, enables subsurface scattering transmittance. Only effective if
subsurf_scatter_enabled is `true`. See also backlight_enabled.

Texture2D subsurf_scatter_transmittance_texture

  * void set_texture(param: TextureParam, texture: Texture2D)

  * Texture2D get_texture(param: TextureParam) const

The texture to use for multiplying the intensity of the subsurface scattering
transmittance intensity. See also subsurf_scatter_texture. Ignored if
subsurf_scatter_skin_mode is `true`.

TextureFilter texture_filter = `3`

  * void set_texture_filter(value: TextureFilter)

  * TextureFilter get_texture_filter()

Filter flags for the texture. See TextureFilter for options.

Note: heightmap_texture is always sampled with linear filtering, even if
nearest-neighbor filtering is selected here. This is to ensure the heightmap
effect looks as intended. If you need sharper height transitions between
pixels, resize the heightmap texture in an image editor with nearest-neighbor
filtering.

bool texture_repeat = `true`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

Repeat flags for the texture. See TextureFilter for options.

Transparency transparency = `0`

  * void set_transparency(value: Transparency)

  * Transparency get_transparency()

The material's transparency mode. Some transparency modes will disable shadow
casting. Any transparency mode other than TRANSPARENCY_DISABLED has a greater
performance impact compared to opaque rendering. See also blend_mode.

bool use_particle_trails = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, enables parts of the shader required for GPUParticles3D trails to
function. This also requires using a mesh with appropriate skinning, such as
RibbonTrailMesh or TubeTrailMesh. Enabling this feature outside of materials
used in GPUParticles3D meshes will break material rendering.

bool use_point_size = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, render point size can be changed.

Note: This is only effective for objects whose geometry is point-based rather
than triangle-based. See also point_size.

Vector3 uv1_offset = `Vector3(0, 0, 0)`

  * void set_uv1_offset(value: Vector3)

  * Vector3 get_uv1_offset()

How much to offset the `UV` coordinates. This amount will be added to `UV` in
the vertex function. This can be used to offset a texture. The Z component is
used when uv1_triplanar is enabled, but it is not used anywhere else.

Vector3 uv1_scale = `Vector3(1, 1, 1)`

  * void set_uv1_scale(value: Vector3)

  * Vector3 get_uv1_scale()

How much to scale the `UV` coordinates. This is multiplied by `UV` in the
vertex function. The Z component is used when uv1_triplanar is enabled, but it
is not used anywhere else.

bool uv1_triplanar = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, instead of using `UV` textures will use a triplanar texture lookup
to determine how to apply textures. Triplanar uses the orientation of the
object's surface to blend between texture coordinates. It reads from the
source texture 3 times, once for each axis and then blends between the results
based on how closely the pixel aligns with each axis. This is often used for
natural features to get a realistic blend of materials. Because triplanar
texturing requires many more texture reads per-pixel it is much slower than
normal UV texturing. Additionally, because it is blending the texture between
the three axes, it is unsuitable when you are trying to achieve crisp
texturing.

float uv1_triplanar_sharpness = `1.0`

  * void set_uv1_triplanar_blend_sharpness(value: float)

  * float get_uv1_triplanar_blend_sharpness()

A lower number blends the texture more softly while a higher number blends the
texture more sharply.

Note: uv1_triplanar_sharpness is clamped between `0.0` and `150.0` (inclusive)
as values outside that range can look broken depending on the mesh.

bool uv1_world_triplanar = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, triplanar mapping for `UV` is calculated in world space rather than
object local space. See also uv1_triplanar.

Vector3 uv2_offset = `Vector3(0, 0, 0)`

  * void set_uv2_offset(value: Vector3)

  * Vector3 get_uv2_offset()

How much to offset the `UV2` coordinates. This amount will be added to `UV2`
in the vertex function. This can be used to offset a texture. The Z component
is used when uv2_triplanar is enabled, but it is not used anywhere else.

Vector3 uv2_scale = `Vector3(1, 1, 1)`

  * void set_uv2_scale(value: Vector3)

  * Vector3 get_uv2_scale()

How much to scale the `UV2` coordinates. This is multiplied by `UV2` in the
vertex function. The Z component is used when uv2_triplanar is enabled, but it
is not used anywhere else.

bool uv2_triplanar = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, instead of using `UV2` textures will use a triplanar texture lookup
to determine how to apply textures. Triplanar uses the orientation of the
object's surface to blend between texture coordinates. It reads from the
source texture 3 times, once for each axis and then blends between the results
based on how closely the pixel aligns with each axis. This is often used for

texturing.

float uv2_triplanar_sharpness = `1.0`

  * void set_uv2_triplanar_blend_sharpness(value: float)

  * float get_uv2_triplanar_blend_sharpness()

A lower number blends the texture more softly while a higher number blends the
texture more sharply.

Note: uv2_triplanar_sharpness is clamped between `0.0` and `150.0` (inclusive)
as values outside that range can look broken depending on the mesh.

bool uv2_world_triplanar = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, triplanar mapping for `UV2` is calculated in world space rather
than object local space. See also uv2_triplanar.

bool vertex_color_is_srgb = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, vertex colors are considered to be stored in sRGB color space and
are converted to linear color space during rendering. If `false`, vertex
colors are considered to be stored in linear color space and are rendered as-
is. See also albedo_texture_force_srgb.

Note: Only effective when using the Forward+ and Mobile rendering methods, not
Compatibility.

bool vertex_color_use_as_albedo = `false`

  * void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

  * bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

If `true`, the vertex color is used as albedo color.

## Method Descriptions

bool get_feature(feature: Feature) const

Returns `true`, if the specified Feature is enabled.

bool get_flag(flag: Flags) const

Returns `true`, if the specified flag is enabled. See Flags enumerator for
options.

Texture2D get_texture(param: TextureParam) const

Returns the Texture2D associated with the specified TextureParam.

void set_feature(feature: Feature, enable: bool)

If `true`, enables the specified Feature. Many features that are available in
BaseMaterial3Ds need to be enabled before use. This way the cost for using the
feature is only incurred when specified. Features can also be enabled by
setting the corresponding member to `true`.

void set_flag(flag: Flags, enable: bool)

If `true`, enables the specified flag. Flags are optional behavior that can be
turned on and off. Only one flag can be enabled at a time with this function,
the flag enumerators cannot be bit-masked together to enable or disable
multiple flags at once. Flags can also be enabled by setting the corresponding
member to `true`. See Flags enumerator for options.

void set_texture(param: TextureParam, texture: Texture2D)

Sets the texture for the slot specified by `param`. See TextureParam for
available slots.
