# SubViewportContainer

Inherits: Container < Control < CanvasItem < Node < Object

A container used for displaying the contents of a SubViewport.

## Description

A container that displays the contents of underlying SubViewport child nodes.
It uses the combined size of the SubViewports as minimum size, unless stretch
is enabled.

Note: Changing a SubViewportContainer's Control.scale will cause its contents
to appear distorted. To change its visual size without causing distortion,
adjust the node's margins instead (if it's not already in a container).

Note: The SubViewportContainer forwards mouse-enter and mouse-exit
notifications to its sub-viewports.

## Properties

FocusMode | focus_mode | `1` (overrides Control)  
---|---|---  
bool | mouse_target | `false`  
bool | stretch | `false`  
int | stretch_shrink | `1`  
  
## Methods

bool | _propagate_input_event(event: InputEvent) virtual const  
---|---  
  
## Property Descriptions

bool mouse_target = `false`

  * void set_mouse_target(value: bool)

  * bool is_mouse_target_enabled()

Configure, if either the SubViewportContainer or alternatively the Control
nodes of its SubViewport children should be available as targets of mouse-
related functionalities, like identifying the drop target in drag-and-drop
operations or cursor shape of hovered Control node.

If `false`, the Control nodes inside its SubViewport children are considered
as targets.

If `true`, the SubViewportContainer itself will be considered as a target.

bool stretch = `false`

  * void set_stretch(value: bool)

  * bool is_stretch_enabled()

If `true`, the sub-viewport will be automatically resized to the control's
size.

Note: If `true`, this will prohibit changing SubViewport.size of its children
manually.

int stretch_shrink = `1`

  * void set_stretch_shrink(value: int)

  * int get_stretch_shrink()

Divides the sub-viewport's effective resolution by this value while preserving
its scale. This can be used to speed up rendering.

For example, a 1280720 sub-viewport with stretch_shrink set to `2` will be
rendered at 640360 while occupying the same size in the container.

Note: stretch must be `true` for this property to work.

## Method Descriptions

bool _propagate_input_event(event: InputEvent) virtual const

Experimental: This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Virtual method to be implemented by the user. If it returns `true`, the
`event` is propagated to SubViewport children. Propagation doesn't happen if
it returns `false`. If the function is not implemented, all events are
propagated to SubViewports.

  *[virtual]: This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.
  *[const]: This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.
  *[void]: No return value.
