# Godot Docs 4.4 branch

Note

Godot's documentation is available in various languages and versions. Expand
the "Read the Docs" panel at the bottom of the sidebar to see the list.

Welcome to the official documentation of Godot Engine, the free and open
source community-driven 2D and 3D game engine! If you are new to this
documentation, we recommend that you read the introduction page to get an
overview of what this documentation has to offer.

The table of contents in the sidebar should let you easily access the
documentation for your topic of interest. You can also use the search function
in the top-left corner.

## Get involved

Godot Engine is an open source project developed by a community of volunteers.
The documentation team can always use your feedback and help to improve the
tutorials and class reference. If you don't understand something, or cannot
find what you are looking for in the docs, help us make the documentation
better by letting us know!

Submit an issue or pull request on the GitHub repository, help us translate
the documentation into your language, or talk to us on the `#documentation`
channel on the Godot Contributors Chat!
