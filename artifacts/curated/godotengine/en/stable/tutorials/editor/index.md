# Editor introduction

In this section, we cover the Godot editor in general, from its interface to
using it with the command line.

## Editor's interface

The following pages explain how to use the various windows, workspaces, and
docks that make up the Godot editor. We cover some specific editors' interface
in other sections where appropriate. For example, the animation editor.

## XR editor

Godot offers a port of the editor designed to run natively on Meta Quest
devices. The port can be downloaded from the Meta Horizon Store, or from the
Godot download page.

## Android editor

Godot offers a native port of the editor running entirely on Android devices.
The Android port can be downloaded from the Android Downloads page. While we
strive for feature parity with the Desktop version of the editor, the Android
port has a certain amount of caveats you should be aware of.

## Web editor

Godot offers an HTML5 version of the editor running entirely in your browser.
No download is required to use it, but it has a certain amount of caveats you
should be aware of.

## Advanced features

The articles below focus on advanced features useful for experienced
developers, such as calling Godot from the command line and using an external
text editor like Visual Studio Code or Emacs.

## Managing editor features

Godot allows you to remove features from the editor. This may be useful if
you're an educator trying to ease students into the editor slowly, or if
you're working on a project that's only 2D or only 3D and don't want to see
what you don't need.
