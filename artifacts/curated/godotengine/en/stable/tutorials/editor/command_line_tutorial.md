# Command line tutorial

Some developers like using the command line extensively. Godot is designed to
be friendly to them, so here are the steps for working entirely from the
command line. Given the engine relies on almost no external libraries,
initialization times are pretty fast, making it suitable for this workflow.

Note

On Windows and Linux, you can run a Godot binary in a terminal by specifying
its relative or absolute path.

On macOS, the process is different due to Godot being contained within an
`.app` bundle (which is a folder, not a file). To run a Godot binary from a
terminal on macOS, you have to `cd` to the folder where the Godot application
bundle is located, then run `Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot` followed by any
command line arguments. If you've renamed the application bundle from `Godot`
to another name, make sure to edit this command line accordingly.

## Path

It is recommended to place your Godot editor binary in your `PATH` environment
variable, so it can be executed easily from any place by typing `godot`. You
can do so on Linux by placing the Godot binary in `/usr/local/bin` and making
sure it is called `godot` (case-sensitive).

To achieve this on Windows or macOS easily, you can install Godot using Scoop
(on Windows) or Homebrew (on macOS). This will automatically make the copy of
Godot installed available in the `PATH`:

WindowsmacOS

    
    
    # Add "Extras" bucket
    scoop bucket add extras
    
    # Standard editor:
    scoop install godot
    
    # Editor with C# support (will be available as `godot-mono` in `PATH`):
    scoop install godot-mono
    
    
    
    # Standard editor:
    brew install godot
    
    # Editor with C# support (will be available as `godot-mono` in `PATH`):
    brew install godot-mono
    

## Setting the project path

Depending on where your Godot binary is located and what your current working
directory is, you may need to set the path to your project for any of the
following commands to work correctly.

When running the editor, this can be done by giving the path to the
`project.godot` file of your project as either the first argument, like this:

    
    
    godot path_to_your_project/project.godot [other] [commands] [and] [args]
    

For all commands, this can be done by using the `--path` argument:

    
    
    godot --path path_to_your_project [other] [commands] [and] [args]
    

For example, the full command for exporting your game (as explained below)
might look like this:

    
    
    godot --headless --path path_to_your_project --export-release my_export_preset_name game.exe
    

When starting from a subdirectory of your project, use the `--upwards`
argument for Godot to automatically find the `project.godot` file by
recursively searching the parent directories.

For example, running a scene (as explained below) nested in a subdirectory
might look like this when your working directory is in the same path:

    
    
    godot --upwards nested_scene.tscn
    

## Creating a project

Creating a project from the command line can be done by navigating the shell
to the desired place and making a `project.godot` file.

    
    
    mkdir newgame
    cd newgame
    touch project.godot
    

The project can now be opened with Godot.

## Running the editor

Running the editor is done by executing Godot with the `-e` flag. This must be
done from within the project directory or by setting the project path as
explained above, otherwise the command is ignored and the Project Manager
appears.

    
    
    godot -e
    

When passing in the full path to the `project.godot` file, the `-e` flag may
be omitted.

If a scene has been created and saved, it can be edited later by running the
same code with that scene as argument.

    
    
    godot -e scene.tscn
    

## Erasing a scene

Godot is friends with your filesystem and will not create extra metadata
files. Use `rm` to erase a scene file. Make sure nothing references that
scene. Otherwise, an error will be thrown upon opening the project.

    
    
    rm scene.tscn
    

## Running the game

To run the game, execute Godot within the project directory or with the
project path as explained above.

    
    
    godot
    

Note that passing in the `project.godot` file will always run the editor
instead of running the game.

When a specific scene needs to be tested, pass that scene to the command line.

    
    
    godot scene.tscn
    

## Debugging

Catching errors in the command line can be a difficult task because they
scroll quickly. For this, a command line debugger is provided by adding `-d`.
It works for running either the game or a single scene.

    
    
    godot -d
    
    
    
    godot -d scene.tscn
    

## Exporting

Exporting the project from the command line is also supported. This is
especially useful for continuous integration setups.

Note

Using the `--headless` command line argument is required on platforms that do
not have GPU access (such as continuous integration). On platforms with GPU
access, `--headless` prevents a window from spawning while the project is
exporting.

    
    
    # `godot` must be a Godot editor binary, not an export template.
    # Also, export templates must be installed for the editor
    # (or a valid custom export template must be defined in the export preset).
    godot --headless --export-release "Linux/X11" /var/builds/project
    godot --headless --export-release Android /var/builds/project.apk
    

The preset name must match the name of an export preset defined in the
project's `export_presets.cfg` file. If the preset name contains spaces or
special characters (such as "Windows Desktop"), it must be surrounded with
quotes.

To export a debug version of the game, use the `--export-debug` switch instead
of `--export-release`. Their parameters and usage are the same.

To export only a PCK file, use the `--export-pack` option followed by the
preset name and output path, with the file extension, instead of `--export-
release` or `--export-debug`. The output path extension determines the
package's format, either PCK or ZIP.

Warning

When specifying a relative path as the path for `--export-release`, `--export-
debug` or `--export-pack`, the path will be relative to the directory
containing the `project.godot` file, not relative to the current working
directory.

## Running a script

It is possible to run a `.gd` script from the command line. This feature is
especially useful in large projects, e.g. for batch conversion of assets or
custom import/export.

The script must inherit from `SceneTree` or `MainLoop`.

Here is an example `sayhello.gd`, showing how it works:

    
    
    #!/usr/bin/env -S godot -s
    extends SceneTree
    
    func _init():
        print("Hello!")
        quit()
    

And how to run it:

    
    
    # Prints "Hello!" to standard output.
    godot -s sayhello.gd
    

If no `project.godot` exists at the path, current path is assumed to be the
current working directory (unless `--path` is specified).

The script path will be interpreted as a resource path relative to the
project, here `res://sayhello.gd`. You can also use an absolute filesystem
path instead, which is useful if the script is located outside of the project
directory.

The first line of `sayhello.gd` above is commonly referred to as a shebang. If
the Godot binary is in your `PATH` as `godot`, it allows you to run the script
as follows in modern Linux distributions, as well as macOS:

    
    
    # Mark script as executable.
    chmod +x sayhello.gd
    # Prints "Hello!" to standard output.
    ./sayhello.gd
    

If the above doesn't work in your current version of Linux or macOS, you can
always have the shebang run Godot straight from where it is located as
follows:

    
    
    #!/usr/bin/godot -s
