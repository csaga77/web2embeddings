# Using NavigationMaps

A NavigationMap is an abstract navigation world on the NavigationServer
identified by a NavigationServer RID.

A map can hold and connect a near infinite number of navigation regions with
navigation meshes to build the traversable areas of a game world for
pathfinding.

A map can contain avoidance agents. Collision avoidance will be calculated
based on the agents present in the map.

Note

Different NavigationMaps are completely isolated from each other but
navigation regions and avoidance agents can switch between different maps.
Switches will become effective on NavigationServer synchronization.

## Default navigation maps

By default Godot creates a navigation map for each World2D and World3D of the
root viewport.

The 2D default navigation map RID can be obtained with
`get_world_2d().get_navigation_map()` from any Node2D inheriting Node.

The 3D default navigation map RID can be obtained with
`get_world_3d().get_navigation_map()` from any Node3D inheriting Node.

    extends Node2D
    
    func _ready() -> void:
        var default_navigation_map_rid: RID = get_world_2d().get_navigation_map()
    
    
    
    public partial class MyNode2D : Node2D
    {
        public override void _Ready()
        {
            Rid defaultNavigationMapRid = GetWorld2D().NavigationMap;
        }
    }
    
    
    
    extends Node3D
    
    func _ready() -> void:
        var default_navigation_map_rid: RID = get_world_3d().get_navigation_map()
    
    
    
    public partial class MyNode3D : Node3D
    {
        public override void _Ready()
        {
            Rid defaultNavigationMapRid = GetWorld3D().NavigationMap;
        }
    }
    

## Creating new navigation maps

The NavigationServer can create and support as many navigation maps as
required for specific gameplay. Additional navigation maps are created and
handled by using the NavigationServer API directly e.g. to support different
avoidance agent or actor locomotion types.

For example uses of different navigation maps see Support different actor
types and Support different actor locomotion.

Each navigation map individually synchronizes queued changes to its navigation
regions and avoidance agents. A navigation map that has not received changes
will consume little to no processing time. Navigation regions and avoidance
agents can only be part of a single navigation map but they can switch map at
any time.

Note

A navigation map switch will take effect only after the next NavigationServer
synchronization.

    extends Node2D
    
    func _ready() -> void:
        var new_navigation_map: RID = NavigationServer2D.map_create()
        NavigationServer2D.map_set_active(new_navigation_map, true)
    
    
    
    public partial class MyNode2D : Node2D
    {
        public override void _Ready()
        {
            Rid newNavigationMap = NavigationServer2D.MapCreate();
            NavigationServer2D.MapSetActive(newNavigationMap, true);
        }
    }
    
    
    
    extends Node3D
    
    func _ready() -> void:
        var new_navigation_map: RID = NavigationServer3D.map_create()
        NavigationServer3D.map_set_active(new_navigation_map, true)
    
    
    
    public partial class MyNode3D : Node3D
    {
        public override void _Ready()
        {
            Rid newNavigationMap = NavigationServer3D.MapCreate();
            NavigationServer3D.MapSetActive(newNavigationMap, true);
        }
    }
    

Note

There is no difference between navigation maps created with the
NavigationServer2D API or the NavigationServer3D API.
