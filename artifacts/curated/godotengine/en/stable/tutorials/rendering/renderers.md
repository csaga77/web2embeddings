# Renderers

See also

This page gives an overview of Godot's renderers, focusing on the differences
between their rendering features. For more technical details on the renderers,
see Internal rendering architecture.

## Introduction

Godot 4 includes three renderers:

  * Forward+. The most advanced renderer, suited for desktop platforms only. Used by default on desktop platforms. This renderer uses Vulkan, Direct3D 12, or Metal as the rendering driver, and it uses the RenderingDevice backend.

  * Mobile. Fewer features, but renders simple scenes faster. Suited for mobile and desktop platforms. Used by default on mobile platforms. This renderer uses Vulkan, Direct3D 12, or Metal as the rendering driver, and it uses the RenderingDevice backend.

  * Compatibility, sometimes called GL Compatibility. The least advanced renderer, suited for low-end desktop and mobile platforms. Used by default on the web platform. This renderer uses OpenGL as the rendering driver.

### Renderers, rendering drivers, and RenderingDevice

Godot's rendering abstraction layers.

The renderer, or rendering method, determines which features are available.
Most of the time, this is the only thing you need to think about. Godot's
renderers are Forward+, Mobile, and Compatibility.

The rendering driver tells the GPU what to do, using a graphics API. Godot can
use the OpenGL, Vulkan, Direct3D 12, and Metal rendering drivers. Not every
GPU supports every rendering driver, and therefore not every GPU supports all
renderers. Vulkan, Direct3D 12, and Metal are modern, low-level graphics APIs,
and requires newer hardware. OpenGL is an older graphics API that runs on most
hardware.

RenderingDevice is a rendering backend, an abstraction layer between the
renderer and the rendering driver. It is used by the Forward+ and Mobile
renderers, and these renderers are sometimes called "RenderingDevice-based
renderers".

## Choosing a renderer

Choosing a renderer is a complex question, and depends on your hardware and
the which platforms you are developing for. As a starting point:

Choose Forward+ if:

>   * You are developing for desktop.
>
>   * You have relatively new hardware which supports Vulkan, Direct3D 12, or
> Metal.
>
>   * You are developing a 3D game.
>
>   * You want to use the most advanced rendering features.
>
>

Choose Mobile if:

>   * You are developing for newer mobile devices, desktop XR, or desktop.
>
>   * You have relatively new hardware which supports Vulkan, Direct3D 12, or
> Metal.
>
>   * You are developing a 3D game.
>
>   * You want to use advanced rendering features, subject to the limitations
> of mobile hardware.
>
>

Choose Compatibility if:

>   * You are developing for older mobile devices, older desktop devices, or
> standalone XR. The Compatibility renderer supports the widest range of
> hardware.
>
>   * You are developing for web. In this case, Compatibility is the only
> choice.
>
>   * You have older hardware which does not support Vulkan. In this case,
> Compatibility is the only choice.
>
>   * You are developing a 2D game, or a 3D game which does not need advanced
> rendering features.
>
>   * You want the best performance possible on all devices and don't need
> advanced rendering features.
>
>

Keep in mind every game is unique, and this is only a starting point. For
example, you might choose to use the Compatibility renderer even though you
have the latest GPU, so you can support the widest range of hardware. Or you
might want to use the Forward+ renderer for a 2D game, so you can advanced
features like compute shaders.

### Switching between renderers

In the editor, you can always switch between renderers by clicking on the
renderer name in the upper-right corner of the editor.

Switching between renderers may require some manual tweaks to your scene,
lighting, and environment, since each renderer is different. In general,
switching between the Mobile and Forward+ renderers will require fewer
adjustments than switching between the Compatibility renderer and the Forward+
or Mobile renderers.

Since Godot 4.4, when using Forward+ or Mobile, if Vulkan is not supported,
the engine will fall back to Direct3D 12 and vice versa. If the attempted
fallback driver is not supported either, the engine will then fall back to
Compatibility when the RenderingDevice backend is not supported. This allows
the project to run anyway, but it may look different than the intended
appearance due to the more limited renderer. This behavior can be disabled in
the project settings by unchecking Rendering > Rendering Device > Fallback to
OpenGL 3.

## Feature comparison

This is not a complete list of the features of each renderer. If a feature is
not listed here, it is available in all renderers, though it may be much
faster on some renderers. For a list of all features in Godot, see List of
features.

Hardware with RenderingDevice support is hardware which can run Vulkan,
Direct3D 12, or Metal.
