# Importing 3D scenes

Godot supports importing 3D scenes from various file formats. This
documentation section describes what those formats are, and how to use them,
including exporting with the correct conventions and best practices, and how
to customize the node type using a suffix in the node name. The import
configuration article describes how to customize the imported data using the
import dock, the advanced import settings dialog, and inherited scenes.

3D scenes can be loaded at runtime using runtime file loading and saving,
including from an exported project.
