# Blender ESCN exporter

To export from Blender to Godot 4.x, use one of the available 3D formats.

The plugin Godot Blender Exporter is not maintained or supported in Godot 4.x.
While not officially supported, the plugin may partially work for some Godot
and Blender versions, particularly before Blender version 4.0. For complete
docs on the Blender exporter, see the previous version of this page.

Built with Sphinx using a theme provided by Read the Docs.
